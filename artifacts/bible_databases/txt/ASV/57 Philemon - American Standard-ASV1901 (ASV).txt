Philemon - American Standard-ASV1901 (ASV)
[1:1] Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our beloved and fellow-worker,
[1:2] and to Apphia our sister, and to Archippus our fellow-soldier, and to the church in thy house:
[1:3] Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:4] I thank my God always, making mention of thee in my prayers,
[1:5] hearing of thy love, and of the faith which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all the saints;
[1:6] that the fellowship of thy faith may become effectual, in the knowledge of every good thing which is in you, unto Christ.
[1:7] For I had much joy and comfort in thy love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through thee, brother.
[1:8] Wherefore, though I have all boldness in Christ to enjoin thee that which is befitting,
[1:9] yet for love's sake I rather beseech, being such a one as Paul the aged, and now a prisoner also of Christ Jesus:
[1:10] I beseech thee for my child, whom I have begotten in my bonds, Onesimus,
[1:11] who once was unprofitable to thee, but now is profitable to thee and to me:
[1:12] whom I have sent back to thee in his own person, that is, my very heart:
[1:13] whom I would fain have kept with me, that in thy behalf he might minister unto me in the bonds of the gospel:
[1:14] but without thy mind I would do nothing; that thy goodness should not be as of necessity, but of free will.
[1:15] For perhaps he was therefore parted `from thee' for a season, that thou shouldest have him for ever;
[1:16] no longer as a servant, but more than a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much rather to thee, both in the flesh and in the Lord.
[1:17] If then thou countest me a partner, receive him as myself.
[1:18] But if he hath wronged the at all, or oweth `thee' aught, put that to mine account;
[1:19] I Paul write it with mine own hand, I will repay it: that I say not unto thee that thou owest to me even thine own self besides.
[1:20] Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my heart in Christ.
[1:21] Having confidence in thine obedience I write unto thee, knowing that thou wilt do even beyond what I say.
[1:22] But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I hope that through your prayers I shall be granted unto you.
[1:23] Epaphras, my fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus, saluteth thee;
[1:24] `and so do' Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow-workers.
[1:25] The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
