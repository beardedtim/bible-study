Proverbs - Young's Literal Translation (YLT)
[1:1] Proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:
[1:2] For knowing wisdom and instruction, For understanding sayings of intelligence,
[1:3] For receiving the instruction of wisdom, Righteousness, judgment, and uprightness,
[1:4] For giving to simple ones -- prudence, To a youth -- knowledge and discretion.
[1:5] (The wise doth hear and increaseth learning, And the intelligent doth obtain counsels.)
[1:6] For understanding a proverb and its sweetness, Words of the wise and their acute sayings.
[1:7] Fear of Jehovah `is' a beginning of knowledge, Wisdom and instruction fools have despised!
[1:8] Hear, my son, the instruction of thy father, And leave not the law of thy mother,
[1:9] For a graceful wreath `are' they to thy head, And chains to thy neck.
[1:10] My son, if sinners entice thee be not willing.
[1:11] If they say, `Come with us, we lay wait for blood, We watch secretly for the innocent without cause,
[1:12] We swallow them as Sheol -- alive, And whole -- as those going down `to' the pit,
[1:13] Every precious substance we find, We fill our houses `with' spoil,
[1:14] Thy lot thou dost cast among us, One purse is -- to all of us.'
[1:15] My son! go not in the way with them, Withhold thy foot from their path,
[1:16] For their feet to evil do run, And they haste to shed blood.
[1:17] Surely in vain is the net spread out before the eyes of any bird.
[1:18] And they for their own blood lay wait, They watch secretly for their own lives.
[1:19] So `are' the paths of every gainer of dishonest gain, The life of its owners it taketh.
[1:20] Wisdom in an out-place crieth aloud, In broad places she giveth forth her voice,
[1:21] At the head of the multitudes she calleth, In the openings of the gates, In the city her sayings she saith:
[1:22] `Till when, ye simple, do ye love simplicity? And have scorners their scorning desired? And do fools hate knowledge?
[1:23] Turn back at my reproof, lo, I pour forth to you my spirit, I make known my words with you.
[1:24] Because I have called, and ye refuse, I stretched out my hand, and none is attending,
[1:25] And ye slight all my counsel, And my reproof ye have not desired.
[1:26] I also in your calamity do laugh, I deride when your fear cometh,
[1:27] When your fear cometh as destruction, And your calamity as a hurricane doth come, When on you come adversity and distress.
[1:28] Then they call me, and I do not answer, They seek me earnestly, and find me not.
[1:29] Because that they have hated knowledge, And the fear of Jehovah have not chosen.
[1:30] They have not consented to my counsel, They have despised all my reproof,
[1:31] And they eat of the fruit of their way, And from their own counsels they are filled.
[1:32] For the turning of the simple slayeth them, And the security of the foolish destroyeth them.
[1:33] And whoso is hearkening to me dwelleth confidently, And `is' quiet from fear of evil!'
[2:1] My son, if thou dost accept my sayings, And my commands dost lay up with thee,
[2:2] To cause thine ear to attend to wisdom, Thou inclinest thy heart to understanding,
[2:3] For, if for intelligence thou callest, For understanding givest forth thy voice,
[2:4] If thou dost seek her as silver, And as hid treasures searchest for her,
[2:5] Then understandest thou fear of Jehovah, And knowledge of God thou findest.
[2:6] For Jehovah giveth wisdom, From His mouth knowledge and understanding.
[2:7] Even to lay up for the upright substance, A shield for those walking uprightly.
[2:8] To keep the paths of judgment, And the way of His saints He preserveth.
[2:9] Then understandest thou righteousness, And judgment, and uprightness -- every good path.
[2:10] For wisdom cometh into thy heart, And knowledge to thy soul is pleasant,
[2:11] Thoughtfulness doth watch over thee, Understanding doth keep thee,
[2:12] To deliver thee from an evil way, From any speaking froward things,
[2:13] Who are forsaking paths of uprightness, To walk in ways of darkness,
[2:14] Who are rejoicing to do evil, They delight in frowardness of the wicked,
[2:15] Whose paths `are' crooked, Yea, they are perverted in their ways.
[2:16] To deliver thee from the strange woman, From the stranger who hath made smooth her sayings,
[2:17] Who is forsaking the guide of her youth, And the covenant of her God hath forgotten.
[2:18] For her house hath inclined unto death, And unto Rephaim her paths.
[2:19] None going in unto her turn back, Nor do they reach the paths of life.
[2:20] That thou dost go in the way of the good, And the paths of the righteous dost keep.
[2:21] For the upright do inhabit the earth, And the perfect are left in it,
[2:22] And the wicked from the earth are cut off, And treacherous dealers plucked out of it!
[3:1] My son! my law forget not, And my commands let thy heart keep,
[3:2] For length of days and years, Life and peace they do add to thee.
[3:3] Let not kindness and truth forsake thee, Bind them on thy neck, Write them on the tablet of thy heart,
[3:4] And find grace and good understanding In the eyes of God and man.
[3:5] Trust unto Jehovah with all thy heart, And unto thine own understanding lean not.
[3:6] In all thy ways know thou Him, And He doth make straight thy paths.
[3:7] Be not wise in thine own eyes, Fear Jehovah, and turn aside from evil.
[3:8] Healing it is to thy navel, And moistening to thy bones.
[3:9] Honour Jehovah from thy substance, And from the beginning of all thine increase;
[3:10] And filled are thy barns `with' plenty, And `with' new wine thy presses break forth.
[3:11] Chastisement of Jehovah, my son, despise not, And be not vexed with His reproof,
[3:12] For whom Jehovah loveth He reproveth, Even as a father the son He is pleased with.
[3:13] O the happiness of a man `who' hath found wisdom, And of a man `who' bringeth forth understanding.
[3:14] For better `is' her merchandise Than the merchandise of silver, And than gold -- her increase.
[3:15] Precious she `is' above rubies, And all thy pleasures are not comparable to her.
[3:16] Length of days `is' in her right hand, In her left `are' wealth and honour.
[3:17] Her ways `are' ways of pleasantness, And all her paths `are' peace.
[3:18] A tree of life she `is' to those laying hold on her, And whoso is retaining her `is' happy.
[3:19] Jehovah by wisdom did found the earth, He prepared the heavens by understanding.
[3:20] By His knowledge depths have been rent, And clouds do drop dew.
[3:21] My son! let them not turn from thine eyes, Keep thou wisdom and thoughtfulness,
[3:22] And they are life to thy soul, and grace to thy neck.
[3:23] Then thou goest thy way confidently, And thy foot doth not stumble.
[3:24] If thou liest down, thou art not afraid, Yea, thou hast lain down, And sweet hath been thy sleep.
[3:25] Be not afraid of sudden fear, And of the desolation of the wicked when it cometh.
[3:26] For Jehovah is at thy side, And He hath kept thy foot from capture.
[3:27] Withhold not good from its owners, When thy hand `is' toward God to do `it'.
[3:28] Say not thou to thy friend, `Go, and return, and to-morrow I give,' And substance with thee.
[3:29] Devise not against thy neighbour evil, And he sitting confidently with thee.
[3:30] Strive not with a man without cause, If he have not done thee evil.
[3:31] Be not envious of a man of violence, Nor fix thou on any of his ways.
[3:32] For an abomination to Jehovah `is' the perverted, And with the upright `is' His secret counsel.
[3:33] The curse of Jehovah `is' in the house of the wicked. And the habitation of the righteous He blesseth.
[3:34] If the scorners He doth scorn, Yet to the humble He doth give grace.
[3:35] Honour do the wise inherit, And fools are bearing away shame!
[4:1] Hear, ye sons, the instruction of a father, And give attention to know understanding.
[4:2] For good learning I have given to you, My law forsake not.
[4:3] For, a son I have been to my father -- tender, And an only one before my mother.
[4:4] And he directeth me, and he saith to me: `Let thy heart retain my words, Keep my commands, and live.
[4:5] Get wisdom, get understanding, Do not forget, nor turn away From the sayings of my mouth.
[4:6] Forsake her not, and she doth preserve thee, Love her, and she doth keep thee.
[4:7] The first thing `is' wisdom -- get wisdom, And with all thy getting get understanding.
[4:8] Exalt her, and she doth lift thee up, She honoureth thee, when thou dost embrace her.
[4:9] She giveth to thy head a wreath of grace, A crown of beauty she doth give thee freely.
[4:10] Hear, my son, and receive my sayings, And years of life `are' multiplied to thee.
[4:11] In a way of wisdom I have directed thee, I have caused thee to tread in paths of uprightness.
[4:12] In thy walking thy step is not straitened, And if thou runnest, thou stumblest not.
[4:13] Lay hold on instruction, do not desist, Keep her, for she `is' thy life.
[4:14] Into the path of the wicked enter not, And be not happy in a way of evil doers.
[4:15] Avoid it, pass not over into it, Turn aside from it, and pass on.
[4:16] For they sleep not if they do not evil, And their sleep hath been taken violently away, If they cause not `some' to stumble.
[4:17] For they have eaten bread of wickedness, And wine of violence they drink.
[4:18] And the path of the righteous `is' as a shining light, Going and brightening till the day is established,
[4:19] The way of the wicked `is' as darkness, They have not known at what they stumble.
[4:20] My son, to my words give attention, To my sayings incline thine ear,
[4:21] Let them not turn aside from thine eyes, Preserve them in the midst of thy heart.
[4:22] For life they `are' to those finding them, And to all their flesh healing.
[4:23] Above every charge keep thy heart, For out of it `are' the outgoings of life.
[4:24] Turn aside from thee a froward mouth, And perverse lips put far from thee,
[4:25] Thine eyes do look straightforward, And thine eyelids look straight before thee.
[4:26] Ponder thou the path of thy feet, And all thy ways `are' established.
[4:27] Incline not `to' the right or to the left, Turn aside thy foot from evil!
[5:1] My son! to my wisdom give attention, To mine understanding incline thine ear,
[5:2] To observe thoughtfulness, And knowledge do thy lips keep.
[5:3] For the lips of a strange woman drop honey, And smoother than oil `is' her mouth,
[5:4] And her latter end `is' bitter as wormwood, Sharp as a sword `with' mouths.
[5:5] Her feet are going down to death, Sheol do her steps take hold of.
[5:6] The path of life -- lest thou ponder, Moved have her paths -- thou knowest not.
[5:7] And now, ye sons, hearken to me, And turn not from sayings of my mouth.
[5:8] Keep far from off her thy way, And come not near unto the opening of her house,
[5:9] Lest thou give to others thy honour, And thy years to the fierce,
[5:10] Lest strangers be filled `with' thy power, And thy labours in the house of a stranger,
[5:11] And thou hast howled in thy latter end, In the consumption of thy flesh and thy food,
[5:12] And hast said, `How have I hated instruction, And reproof hath my heart despised,
[5:13] And I have not hearkened to the voice of my directors, And to my teachers have not inclined mine ear.
[5:14] As a little thing I have been all evil, In the midst of an assembly and a company.
[5:15] Drink waters out of thine own cistern, Even flowing ones out of thine own well.
[5:16] Let thy fountains be scattered abroad, In broad places rivulets of waters.
[5:17] Let them be to thee for thyself, And not to strangers with thee.
[5:18] Let thy fountain be blessed, And rejoice because of the wife of thy youth,
[5:19] A hind of loves, and a roe of grace! Let her loves satisfy thee at all times, In her love magnify thyself continually.
[5:20] And why dost thou magnify thyself, My son, with a stranger? And embrace the bosom of a strange woman?
[5:21] For over-against the eyes of Jehovah are the ways of each, And all his paths He is pondering.
[5:22] His own iniquities do capture the wicked, And with the ropes of his sin he is holden.
[5:23] He dieth without instruction, And in the abundance of his folly magnifieth himself!
[6:1] My son! if thou hast been surety for thy friend, Hast stricken for a stranger thy hand,
[6:2] Hast been snared with sayings of thy mouth, Hast been captured with sayings of thy mouth,
[6:3] Do this now, my son, and be delivered, For thou hast come into the hand of thy friend. Go, trample on thyself, and strengthen thy friend,
[6:4] Give not sleep to thine eyes, And slumber to thine eyelids,
[6:5] Be delivered as a roe from the hand, And as a bird from the hand of a fowler.
[6:6] Go unto the ant, O slothful one, See her ways and be wise;
[6:7] Which hath not captain, overseer, and ruler,
[6:8] She doth prepare in summer her bread, She hath gathered in harvest her food.
[6:9] Till when, O slothful one, dost thou lie? When dost thou arise from thy sleep?
[6:10] A little sleep, a little slumber, A little clasping of the hands to rest,
[6:11] And thy poverty hath come as a traveller, And thy want as an armed man.
[6:12] A man of worthlessness, a man of iniquity, Walking `with' perverseness of mouth,
[6:13] Winking with his eyes, speaking with his feet, Directing with his fingers,
[6:14] Frowardness `is' in his heart, devising evil at all times, Contentions he sendeth forth.
[6:15] Therefore suddenly cometh his calamity, Instantly he is broken -- and no healing.
[6:16] These six hath Jehovah hated, Yea, seven `are' abominations to His soul.
[6:17] Eyes high -- tongues false -- And hands shedding innocent blood --
[6:18] A heart devising thoughts of vanity -- Feet hasting to run to evil --
[6:19] A false witness `who' doth breathe out lies -- And one sending forth contentions between brethren.
[6:20] Keep, my son, the command of thy father, And leave not the law of thy mother.
[6:21] Bind them on thy heart continually, Tie them on thy neck.
[6:22] In thy going up and down, it leadeth thee, In thy lying down, it watcheth over thee, And thou hast awaked -- it talketh `with' thee.
[6:23] For a lamp `is' the command, And the law a light, And a way of life `are' reproofs of instruction,
[6:24] To preserve thee from an evil woman, From the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.
[6:25] Desire not her beauty in thy heart, And let her not take thee with her eyelids.
[6:26] For a harlot consumeth unto a cake of bread, And an adulteress the precious soul hunteth.
[6:27] Doth a man take fire into his bosom, And are his garments not burnt?
[6:28] Doth a man walk on the hot coals, And are his feet not scorched?
[6:29] So `is' he who hath gone in unto the wife of his neighbour, None who doth touch her is innocent.
[6:30] They do not despise the thief, When he stealeth to fill his soul when he is hungry,
[6:31] And being found he repayeth sevenfold, All the substance of his house he giveth.
[6:32] He who committeth adultery `with' a woman lacketh heart, He is destroying his soul who doth it.
[6:33] A stroke and shame he doth find, And his reproach is not wiped away,
[6:34] For jealousy `is' the fury of a man, And he doth not spare in a day of vengeance.
[6:35] He accepteth not the appearance of any atonement, Yea, he doth not consent, Though thou dost multiply bribes!
[7:1] My son! keep my sayings, And my commands lay up with thee.
[7:2] Keep my commands, and live, And my law as the pupil of thine eye.
[7:3] Bind them on thy fingers, Write them on the tablet of thy heart.
[7:4] Say to wisdom, `My sister Thou `art'.' And cry to understanding, `Kinswoman!'
[7:5] To preserve thee from a strange woman, From a stranger who hath made smooth her sayings.
[7:6] For, at a window of my house, Through my casement I have looked out,
[7:7] And I do see among the simple ones, I discern among the sons, A young man lacking understanding,
[7:8] Passing on in the street, near her corner, And the way `to' her house he doth step,
[7:9] In the twilight -- in the evening of day, In the darkness of night and blackness.
[7:10] And, lo, a woman to meet him -- (A harlot's dress, and watchful of heart,
[7:11] Noisy she `is', and stubborn, In her house her feet rest not.
[7:12] Now in an out-place, now in broad places, And near every corner she lieth in wait) --
[7:13] And she laid hold on him, and kissed him, She hath hardened her face, and saith to him,
[7:14] `Sacrifices of peace-offerings `are' by me, To-day I have completed my vows.
[7:15] Therefore I have come forth to meet thee, To seek earnestly thy face, and I find thee.
[7:16] `With' ornamental coverings I decked my couch, Carved works -- cotton of Egypt.
[7:17] I sprinkled my bed -- myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
[7:18] Come, we are filled `with' loves till the morning, We delight ourselves in loves.
[7:19] For the man is not in his house, He hath gone on a long journey.
[7:20] A bag of money he hath taken in his hand, At the day of the new moon he cometh to his house.'
[7:21] She turneth him aside with the abundance of her speech, With the flattery of her lips she forceth him.
[7:22] He is going after her straightway, As an ox unto the slaughter he cometh, And as a fetter unto the chastisement of a fool,
[7:23] Till an arrow doth split his liver, As a bird hath hastened unto a snare, And hath not known that it `is' for its life.
[7:24] And now, ye sons, hearken to me, And give attention to sayings of my mouth.
[7:25] Let not thy heart turn unto her ways, Do not wander in her paths,
[7:26] For many `are' the wounded she caused to fall, And mighty `are' all her slain ones.
[7:27] The ways of Sheol -- her house, Going down unto inner chambers of death!
[8:1] Doth not wisdom call? And understanding give forth her voice?
[8:2] At the head of high places by the way, Between the paths she hath stood,
[8:3] At the side of the gates, at the mouth of the city, The entrance of the openings, she crieth aloud,
[8:4] `Unto you, O men, I call, And my voice `is' unto the sons of men.
[8:5] Understand, ye simple ones, prudence, And ye fools, understand the heart,
[8:6] Hearken, for noble things I speak, And the opening of my lips `is' uprightness.
[8:7] For truth doth my mouth utter, And an abomination to my lips `is' wickedness.
[8:8] In righteousness `are' all the sayings of my mouth, Nothing in them is froward and perverse.
[8:9] All of them `are' plain to the intelligent, And upright to those finding knowledge.
[8:10] Receive my instruction, and not silver, And knowledge rather than choice gold.
[8:11] For better `is' wisdom than rubies, Yea, all delights are not comparable with it.
[8:12] I, wisdom, have dwelt with prudence, And a knowledge of devices I find out.
[8:13] The fear of Jehovah `is' to hate evil; Pride, and arrogance, and an evil way, And a froward mouth, I have hated.
[8:14] Mine `is' counsel and substance, I `am' understanding, I have might.
[8:15] By me kings reign, and princes decree righteousness,
[8:16] By me do chiefs rule, and nobles, All judges of the earth.
[8:17] I love those loving me, And those seeking me earnestly do find me.
[8:18] Wealth and honour `are' with me, Lasting substance and righteousness.
[8:19] Better `is' my fruit than gold, even fine gold, And mine increase than choice silver.
[8:20] In a path of righteousness I cause to walk, In midst of paths of judgment,
[8:21] To cause my lovers to inherit substance, Yea, their treasures I fill.
[8:22] Jehovah possessed me -- the beginning of His way, Before His works since then.
[8:23] From the age I was anointed, from the first, From former states of the earth.
[8:24] In there being no depths, I was brought forth, In there being no fountains heavy `with' waters,
[8:25] Before mountains were sunk, Before heights, I was brought forth.
[8:26] While He had not made the earth, and out-places, And the top of the dusts of the world.
[8:27] In His preparing the heavens I `am' there, In His decreeing a circle on the face of the deep,
[8:28] In His strengthening clouds above, In His making strong fountains of the deep,
[8:29] In His setting for the sea its limit, And the waters transgress not His command, In His decreeing the foundations of earth,
[8:30] Then I am near Him, a workman, And I am a delight -- day by day. Rejoicing before Him at all times,
[8:31] Rejoicing in the habitable part of His earth, And my delights `are' with the sons of men.
[8:32] And now, ye sons, hearken to me, Yea, happy are they who keep my ways.
[8:33] Hear instruction, and be wise, and slight not.
[8:34] O the happiness of the man hearkening to me, To watch at my doors day by day, To watch at the door-posts of my entrance.
[8:35] For whoso is finding me, hath found life, And bringeth out good-will from Jehovah.
[8:36] And whoso is missing me, is wronging his soul, All hating me have loved death!
[9:1] Wisdom hath builded her house, She hath hewn out her pillars -- seven.
[9:2] She hath slaughtered her slaughter, She hath mingled her wine, Yea, she hath arranged her table.
[9:3] She hath sent forth her damsels, She crieth on the tops of the high places of the city:
[9:4] `Who `is' simple? let him turn aside hither.' Whoso lacketh heart: she hath said to him,
[9:5] `Come, eat of my bread, And drink of the wine I have mingled.
[9:6] Forsake ye, the simple, and live, And be happy in the way of understanding.
[9:7] The instructor of a scorner Is receiving for it -- shame, And a reprover of the wicked -- his blemish.
[9:8] Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee, Give reproof to the wise, and he loveth thee.
[9:9] Give to the wise, and he is wiser still, Make known to the righteous, And he increaseth learning.
[9:10] The commencement of wisdom `is' the fear of Jehovah, And a knowledge of the Holy Ones `is' understanding.
[9:11] For by me do thy days multiply, And added to thee are years of life.
[9:12] If thou hast been wise, thou hast been wise for thyself, And thou hast scorned -- thyself bearest `it'.
[9:13] A foolish woman `is' noisy, Simple, and hath not known what.
[9:14] And she hath sat at the opening of her house, On a throne -- the high places of the city,
[9:15] To call to those passing by the way, Who are going straight `on' their paths.
[9:16] `Who `is' simple? let him turn aside hither.' And whoso lacketh heart -- she said to him,
[9:17] `Stolen waters are sweet, And hidden bread is pleasant.'
[9:18] And he hath not known that Rephaim `are' there, In deep places of Sheol her invited ones!
[10:1] Proverbs of Solomon. A wise son causeth a father to rejoice, And a foolish son `is' an affliction to his mother.
[10:2] Treasures of wickedness profit not, And righteousness delivereth from death.
[10:3] Jehovah causeth not the soul of the righteous to hunger, And the desire of the wicked He thrusteth away.
[10:4] Poor `is' he who is working -- a slothful hand, And the hand of the diligent maketh rich.
[10:5] Whoso is gathering in summer `is' a wise son, Whoso is sleeping in harvest `is' a son causing shame.
[10:6] Blessings `are' for the head of the righteous, And the mouth of the wicked cover doth violence.
[10:7] The remembrance of the righteous `is' for a blessing, And the name of the wicked doth rot.
[10:8] The wise in heart accepteth commands, And a talkative fool kicketh.
[10:9] Whoso is walking in integrity walketh confidently, And whoso is perverting his ways is known.
[10:10] Whoso is winking the eye giveth grief, And a talkative fool kicketh.
[10:11] A fountain of life `is' the mouth of the righteous, And the mouth of the wicked cover doth violence.
[10:12] Hatred awaketh contentions, And over all transgressions love covereth.
[10:13] In the lips of the intelligent is wisdom found, And a rod `is' for the back of him who is lacking understanding.
[10:14] The wise lay up knowledge, and the mouth of a fool `is' near ruin.
[10:15] The wealth of the rich `is' his strong city, The ruin of the poor `is' their poverty.
[10:16] The wage of the righteous `is' for life, The increase of the wicked for sin.
[10:17] A traveller to life `is' he who is keeping instruction, And whoso is forsaking rebuke is erring.
[10:18] Whoso is covering hatred with lying lips, And whoso is bringing out an evil report is a fool.
[10:19] In the abundance of words transgression ceaseth not, And whoso is restraining his lips `is' wise.
[10:20] The tongue of the righteous `is' chosen silver, The heart of the wicked -- as a little thing.
[10:21] The lips of the righteous delight many, And fools for lack of heart die.
[10:22] The blessing of Jehovah -- it maketh rich, And He addeth no grief with it.
[10:23] To execute inventions `is' as play to a fool, And wisdom to a man of understanding.
[10:24] The feared thing of the wicked it meeteth him, And the desire of the righteous is given.
[10:25] As the passing by of a hurricane, So the wicked is not, And the righteous is a foundation age-during.
[10:26] As vinegar to the teeth, And as smoke to the eyes, So `is' the slothful to those sending him.
[10:27] The fear of Jehovah addeth days, And the years of the wicked are shortened.
[10:28] The hope of the righteous `is' joyful, And the expectation of the wicked perisheth.
[10:29] The way of Jehovah `is' strength to the perfect, And ruin to workers of iniquity.
[10:30] The righteous to the age is not moved, And the wicked inhabit not the earth.
[10:31] The mouth of the righteous uttereth wisdom, And the tongue of frowardness is cut out.
[10:32] The lips of the righteous know a pleasing thing, And the mouth of the wicked perverseness!
[11:1] Balances of deceit `are' an abomination to Jehovah, And a perfect weight `is' His delight.
[11:2] Pride hath come, and shame cometh, And with the lowly `is' wisdom.
[11:3] The integrity of the upright leadeth them, And the perverseness of the treacherous destroyeth them.
[11:4] Wealth profiteth not in a day of wrath, And righteousness delivereth from death.
[11:5] The righteousness of the perfect maketh right his way, And by his wickedness doth the wicked fall.
[11:6] The righteousness of the upright delivereth them, And in mischief the treacherous are captured.
[11:7] In the death of a wicked man, hope perisheth, And the expectation of the iniquitous hath been lost.
[11:8] The righteous from distress is drawn out, And the wicked goeth in instead of him.
[11:9] With the mouth a hypocrite corrupteth his friend, And by knowledge the righteous are drawn out.
[11:10] In the good of the righteous a city exulteth, And in the destruction of the wicked `is' singing.
[11:11] By the blessing of the upright is a city exalted, And by the mouth of the wicked thrown down.
[11:12] Whoso is despising his neighbour lacketh heart, And a man of understanding keepeth silence.

[18:22] `Whoso' hath found a wife hath found good, And bringeth out good-will from Jehovah.
[18:23] `With' supplications doth the poor speak, And the rich answereth fierce things.
[18:24] A man with friends `is' to show himself friendly, And there is a lover adhering more than a brother!
[19:1] Better `is' the poor walking in his integrity, Than the perverse `in' his lips, who `is' a fool.

[19:19] A man of great wrath is bearing punishment, For, if thou dost deliver, yet again thou dost add.

[20:6] A multitude of men proclaim each his kindness, And a man of stedfastness who doth find?
[20:7] The righteous is walking habitually in his integrity, O the happiness of his sons after him!
[20:8] A king sitting on a throne of judgment, Is scattering with his eyes all evil,
[20:9] Who saith, `I have purified my heart, I have been cleansed from my sin?'

[20:18] Purposes by counsel thou dost establish, And with plans make thou war.
[20:19] A revealer of secret counsels is the busybody, And for a deceiver `with' his lips make not thyself surety.
[20:20] Whoso is vilifying his father and his mother, Extinguished is his lamp in blackness of darkness.
[20:21] An inheritance gotten wrongly at first, Even its latter end is not blessed.
[20:22] Do not say, `I recompense evil,' Wait for Jehovah, and He delivereth thee.
[20:23] An abomination to Jehovah `are' a stone and a stone, And balances of deceit `are' not good.
[20:24] From Jehovah `are' the steps of a man, And man -- how understandeth he his way?
[20:25] A snare to a man `is' he hath swallowed a holy thing, And after vows to make inquiry.
[20:26] A wise king is scattering the wicked, And turneth back on them the wheel.
[20:27] The breath of man `is' a lamp of Jehovah, Searching all the inner parts of the heart.
[20:28] Kindness and truth keep a king, And he hath supported by kindness his throne.
[20:29] The beauty of young men is their strength, And the honour of old men is grey hairs.
[20:30] The bandages of a wound thou removest with the evil, Also the plagues of the inner parts of the heart!
[21:1] Rivulets of waters `is' the heart of a king in the hand of Jehovah, Wherever He pleaseth He inclineth it.
[21:2] Every way of a man `is' right in his own eyes, And Jehovah is pondering hearts.
[21:3] To do righteousness and judgment, Is chosen of Jehovah rather than sacrifice.
[21:4] Loftiness of eyes, and breadth of heart, Tillage of the wicked `is' sin.
[21:5] The purposes of the diligent `are' only to advantage, And of every hasty one, only to want.
[21:6] The making of treasures by a lying tongue, `Is' a vanity driven away of those seeking death.
[21:7] The spoil of the wicked catcheth them, Because they have refused to do judgment.
[21:8] Froward `is' the way of a man who is vile, And the pure -- upright `is' his work.
[21:9] Better to sit on a corner of the roof, Than `with' a woman of contentions and a house of company.
[21:10] The soul of the wicked hath desired evil, Not gracious in his eyes is his neighbour.
[21:11] When the scorner is punished, the simple becometh wise, And in giving understanding to the wise He receiveth knowledge.
[21:12] The Righteous One is acting wisely Towards the house of the wicked, He is overthrowing the wicked for wickedness.
[21:13] Whoso is shutting his ear from the cry of the poor, He also doth cry, and is not answered.
[21:14] A gift in secret pacifieth anger, And a bribe in the bosom strong fury.
[21:15] To do justice `is' joy to the righteous, But ruin to workers of iniquity.
[21:16] A man who is wandering from the way of understanding, In an assembly of Rephaim resteth.
[21:17] Whoso `is' loving mirth `is' a poor man, Whoso is loving wine and oil maketh no wealth.
[21:18] The wicked `is' an atonement for the righteous, And for the upright the treacherous dealer.
[21:19] Better to dwell in a wilderness land, Than `with' a woman of contentions and anger.
[21:20] A treasure to be desired, and oil, `Is' in the habitation of the wise, And a foolish man swalloweth it up.
[21:21] Whoso is pursuing righteousness and kindness, Findeth life, righteousness, and honour.
[21:22] A city of the mighty hath the wise gone up, And bringeth down the strength of its confidence.
[21:23] Whoso is keeping his mouth and his tongue, Is keeping from adversities his soul.
[21:24] Proud, haughty, scorner `is' his name, Who is working in the wrath of pride.
[21:25] The desire of the slothful slayeth him, For his hands have refused to work.
[21:26] All the day desiring he hath desired, And the righteous giveth and withholdeth not.
[21:27] The sacrifice of the wicked `is' abomination, Much more when in wickedness he bringeth it.
[21:28] A false witness doth perish, And an attentive man for ever speaketh.
[21:29] A wicked man hath hardened by his face, And the upright -- he prepareth his way.
[21:30] There is no wisdom, nor understanding, Nor counsel, over-against Jehovah.
[21:31] A horse is prepared for a day of battle, And the deliverance `is' of Jehovah!
[22:1] A name is chosen rather than much wealth, Than silver and than gold -- good grace.
[22:2] Rich and poor have met together, The Maker of them all `is' Jehovah.
[22:3] The prudent hath seen the evil, and is hidden, And the simple have passed on, and are punished.
[22:4] The end of humility `is' the fear of Jehovah, Riches, and honour, and life.
[22:5] Thorns -- snares `are' in the way of the perverse, Whoso is keeping his soul is far from them.
[22:6] Give instruction to a youth about his way, Even when he is old he turneth not from it.
[22:7] The rich over the poor ruleth, And a servant `is' the borrower to the lender.
[22:8] Whoso is sowing perverseness reapeth sorrow, And the rod of his anger weareth out.
[22:9] The good of eye -- he is blessed, For he hath given of his bread to the poor.
[22:10] Cast out a scorner -- and contention goeth out, And strife and shame cease.
[22:11] Whoso is loving cleanness of heart, Grace `are' his lips, a king `is' his friend.
[22:12] The eyes of Jehovah have kept knowledge, And He overthroweth the words of the treacherous.
[22:13] The slothful hath said, `A lion `is' without, In the midst of the broad places I am slain.'
[22:14] A deep pit `is' the mouth of strange women, The abhorred of Jehovah falleth there.
[22:15] Folly is bound up in the heart of a youth, The rod of chastisement putteth it far from him.
[22:16] He is oppressing the poor to multiply to him, He is giving to the rich -- only to want.
[22:17] Incline thine ear, and hear words of the wise, And thy heart set to my knowledge,
[22:18] For they are pleasant when thou dost keep them in thy heart, They are prepared together for thy lips.
[22:19] That thy trust may be in Jehovah, I caused thee to know to-day, even thou.
[22:20] Have I not written to thee three times With counsels and knowledge?
[22:21] To cause thee to know the certainty of sayings of truth, To return sayings of truth to those sending thee.
[22:22] Rob not the poor because he `is' poor, And bruise not the afflicted in the gate.
[22:23] For Jehovah pleadeth their cause, And hath spoiled the soul of their spoilers.
[22:24] Shew not thyself friendly with an angry man, And with a man of fury go not in,
[22:25] Lest thou learn his paths, And have received a snare to thy soul.
[22:26] Be not thou among those striking hands, Among sureties `for' burdens.
[22:27] If thou hast nothing to pay, Why doth he take thy bed from under thee?
[22:28] Remove not a border of olden times, That thy fathers have made.
[22:29] Hast thou seen a man speedy in his business? Before kings he doth station himself, He stations not himself before obscure men!
[23:1] When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, Thou considerest diligently that which `is' before thee,
[23:2] And thou hast put a knife to thy throat, If thou `art' a man of appetite.
[23:3] Have no desire to his dainties, seeing it `is' lying food.
[23:4] Labour not to make wealth, From thine own understanding cease, Dost thou cause thine eyes to fly upon it? Then it is not.
[23:5] For wealth maketh to itself wings, As an eagle it flieth to the heavens.
[23:6] Eat not the bread of an evil eye, And have no desire to his dainties,
[23:7] For as he hath thought in his soul, so `is' he, `Eat and drink,' saith he to thee, And his heart `is' not with thee.
[23:8] Thy morsel thou hast eaten thou dost vomit up, And hast marred thy words that `are' sweet.
[23:9] In the ears of a fool speak not, For he treadeth on the wisdom of thy words.
[23:10] Remove not a border of olden times, And into fields of the fatherless enter not,
[23:11] For their Redeemer `is' strong, He doth plead their cause with thee.
[23:12] Bring in to instruction thy heart, And thine ear to sayings of knowledge.
[23:13] Withhold not from a youth chastisement, When thou smitest him with a rod he dieth not.
[23:14] Thou with a rod smitest him, And his soul from Sheol thou deliverest.
[23:15] My son, if thy heart hath been wise, My heart rejoiceth, even mine,
[23:16] And my reins exult when thy lips speak uprightly.
[23:17] Let not thy heart be envious at sinners, But -- in the fear of Jehovah all the day.
[23:18] For, is there a posterity? Then thy hope is not cut off.
[23:19] Hear thou, my son, and be wise, And make happy in the way thy heart,
[23:20] Be not thou among quaffers of wine, Among gluttonous ones of flesh,
[23:21] For the quaffer and glutton become poor, And drowsiness clotheth with rags.
[23:22] Hearken to thy father, who begat thee, And despise not thy mother when she hath become old.
[23:23] Truth buy, and sell not, Wisdom, and instruction, and understanding,
[23:24] The father of the righteous rejoiceth greatly, The begetter of the wise rejoiceth in him.
[23:25] Rejoice doth thy father and thy mother, Yea, she that bare thee is joyful.
[23:26] Give, my son, thy heart to me, And let thine eyes watch my ways.
[23:27] For a harlot `is' a deep ditch, And a strange woman `is' a strait pit.
[23:28] She also, as catching prey, lieth in wait, And the treacherous among men she increaseth.
[23:29] Who hath wo? who hath sorrow? Who hath contentions? who hath plaint? Who hath wounds without cause? Who hath redness of eyes?
[23:30] Those tarrying by the wine, Those going in to search out mixed wine.
[23:31] See not wine when it showeth itself red, When it giveth in the cup its colour, It goeth up and down through the upright.
[23:32] Its latter end -- as a serpent it biteth, And as a basilisk it stingeth.
[23:33] Thine eyes see strange women, And thy heart speaketh perverse things.
[23:34] And thou hast been as one lying down in the heart of the sea, And as one lying down on the top of a mast.
[23:35] `They smote me, I have not been sick, They beat me, I have not known. When I awake -- I seek it yet again!'
[24:1] Be not envious of evil men, And desire not to be with them.
[24:2] For destruction doth their heart meditate, And perverseness do their lips speak.
[24:3] By wisdom is a house builded, And by understanding it establisheth itself.
[24:4] And by knowledge the inner parts are filled, `With' all precious and pleasant wealth.
[24:5] Mighty `is' the wise in strength, And a man of knowledge is strengthening power,
[24:6] For by plans thou makest for thyself war, And deliverance `is' in a multitude of counsellors.
[24:7] Wisdom `is' high for a fool, In the gate he openeth not his mouth.
[24:8] Whoso is devising to do evil, Him they call a master of wicked thoughts.
[24:9] The thought of folly `is' sin, And an abomination to man `is' a scorner.
[24:10] Thou hast shewed thyself weak in a day of adversity, Straitened is thy power,
[24:11] If `from' delivering those taken to death, And those slipping to the slaughter -- thou keepest back.
[24:12] When thou sayest, `Lo, we knew not this.' Is not the Ponderer of hearts He who understandeth? And the Keeper of thy soul He who knoweth? And He hath rendered to man according to his work.
[24:13] Eat my son, honey that `is' good, And the honeycomb -- sweet to thy palate.
[24:14] So `is' the knowledge of wisdom to thy soul, If thou hast found that there is a posterity And thy hope is not cut off.
[24:15] Lay not wait, O wicked one, At the habitation of the righteous. Do not spoil his resting-place.
[24:16] For seven `times' doth the righteous fall and rise, And the wicked stumble in evil.
[24:17] In the falling of thine enemy rejoice not, And in his stumbling let not thy heart be joyful,
[24:18] Lest Jehovah see, and `it be' evil in His eyes, And He hath turned from off him His anger.
[24:19] Fret not thyself at evil doers, Be not envious at the wicked,
[24:20] For there is not a posterity to the evil, The lamp of the wicked is extinguished.
[24:21] Fear Jehovah, my son, and the king, With changers mix not up thyself,
[24:22] For suddenly doth their calamity rise, And the ruin of them both -- who knoweth!
[24:23] These also are for the wise: -- To discern faces in judgment is not good.
[24:24] Whoso is saying to the wicked, `Thou `art' righteous,' Peoples execrate him -- nations abhor him.
[24:25] And to those reproving it is pleasant, And on them cometh a good blessing.
[24:26] Lips he kisseth who is returning straightforward words.
[24:27] Prepare in an out-place thy work, And make it ready in the field -- go afterwards, Then thou hast built thy house.
[24:28] Be not a witness for nought against thy neighbour, Or thou hast enticed with thy lips.
[24:29] Say not, `As he did to me, so I do to him, I render to each according to his work.'
[24:30] Near the field of a slothful man I passed by, And near the vineyard of a man lacking heart.
[24:31] And lo, it hath gone up -- all of it -- thorns! Covered its face have nettles, And its stone wall hath been broken down.
[24:32] And I see -- I -- I do set my heart, I have seen -- I have received instruction,
[24:33] A little sleep -- a little slumber -- A little folding of the hands to lie down.
[24:34] And thy poverty hath come `as' a traveller, And thy want as an armed man!
[25:1] Also these are Proverbs of Solomon, that men of Hezekiah king of Judah transcribed: --
[25:2] The honour of God `is' to hide a thing, And the honour of kings to search out a matter.
[25:3] The heavens for height, and the earth for depth, And the heart of kings -- `are' unsearchable.
[25:4] Take away dross from silver, And a vessel for the refiner goeth forth,
[25:5] Take away the wicked before a king, And established in righteousness is his throne.
[25:6] Honour not thyself before a king, And in the place of the great stand not.
[25:7] For better `that' he hath said to thee, `Come thou up hither,' Than `that' he humble thee before a noble, Whom thine eyes have seen.
[25:8] Go not forth to strive, haste, turn, What dost thou in its latter end, When thy neighbour causeth thee to blush?
[25:9] Thy cause plead with thy neighbour, And the secret counsel of another reveal not,
[25:10] Lest the hearer put thee to shame, And thine evil report turn not back.
[25:11] Apples of gold in imagery of silver, `Is' the word spoken at its fit times.
[25:12] A ring of gold, and an ornament of pure gold, `Is' the wise reprover to an attentive ear.
[25:13] As a vessel of snow in a day of harvest, `So is' a faithful ambassador to those sending him, And the soul of his masters he refresheth.
[25:14] Clouds and wind, and rain there is none, `Is' a man boasting himself in a false gift.
[25:15] By long-suffering is a ruler persuaded, And a soft tongue breaketh a bone.
[25:16] Honey thou hast found -- eat thy sufficiency, Lest thou be satiated `with' it, and hast vomited it.
[25:17] Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour's house, Lest he be satiated `with' thee, and have hated thee.
[25:18] A maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow, `Is' the man testifying against his neighbour a false testimony.
[25:19] A bad tooth, and a tottering foot, `Is' the confidence of the treacherous in a day of adversity.
[25:20] Whoso is taking away a garment in a cold day, `Is as' vinegar on nitre, And a singer of songs on a sad heart.
[25:21] If he who is hating thee doth hunger, cause him to eat bread, And if he thirst, cause him to drink water.
[25:22] For coals thou art putting on his head, And Jehovah giveth recompense to thee.
[25:23] A north wind bringeth forth rain, And a secret tongue -- indignant faces.
[25:24] Better to sit on a corner of a roof, Than `with' a woman of contentions, and a house of company.
[25:25] `As' cold waters for a weary soul, So `is' a good report from a far country.
[25:26] A spring troubled, and a fountain corrupt, `Is' the righteous falling before the wicked.
[25:27] The eating of much honey is not good, Nor a searching out of one's own honour -- honour.
[25:28] A city broken down without walls, `Is' a man without restraint over his spirit!
[26:1] As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, So honour `is' not comely for a fool.
[26:2] As a bird by wandering, as a swallow by flying, So reviling without cause doth not come.
[26:3] A whip is for a horse, a bridle for an ass, And a rod for the back of fools.
[26:4] Answer not a fool according to his folly, Lest thou be like to him -- even thou.
[26:5] Answer a fool according to his folly, Lest he be wise in his own eyes.
[26:6] He is cutting off feet, he is drinking injury, Who is sending things by the hand of a fool.
[26:7] Weak have been the two legs of the lame, And a parable in the mouth of fools.
[26:8] As one who is binding a stone in a sling, So `is' he who is giving honour to a fool.
[26:9] A thorn hath gone up into the hand of a drunkard, And a parable in the mouth of fools.
[26:10] Great `is' the Former of all, And He is rewarding a fool, And is rewarding transgressors.
[26:11] As a dog hath returned to its vomit, A fool is repeating his folly.
[26:12] Thou hast seen a man wise in his own eyes, More hope of a fool than of him!
[26:13] The slothful hath said, `A lion `is' in the way, A lion `is' in the broad places.'
[26:14] The door turneth round on its hinge, And the slothful on his bed.
[26:15] The slothful hath hid his hand in a dish, He is weary of bringing it back to his mouth.
[26:16] Wiser `is' the slothful in his own eyes, Than seven `men' returning a reason.
[26:17] Laying hold on the ears of a dog, `Is' a passer-by making himself wrath for strife not his own.
[26:18] As `one' pretending to be feeble, Who is casting sparks, arrows, and death,
[26:19] So hath a man deceived his neighbour, And hath said, `Am not I playing?'
[26:20] Without wood is fire going out, And without a tale-bearer, contention ceaseth,
[26:21] Coal to burning coals, and wood to fire, And a man of contentions to kindle strife.
[26:22] The words of a tale-bearer `are' as self-inflicted wounds, And they have gone down `to' the inner parts of the heart.
[26:23] Silver of dross spread over potsherd, `Are' burning lips and an evil heart.
[26:24] By his lips doth a hater dissemble, And in his heart he placeth deceit,
[26:25] When his voice is gracious trust not in him, For seven abominations `are' in his heart.
[26:26] Hatred is covered by deceit, Revealed is its wickedness in an assembly.
[26:27] Whoso is digging a pit falleth into it, And the roller of a stone, to him it turneth.
[26:28] A lying tongue hateth its bruised ones, And a flattering mouth worketh an overthrow!
[27:1] Boast not thyself of to-morrow, For thou knowest not what a day bringeth forth.
[27:2] Let another praise thee, and not thine own mouth, A stranger, and not thine own lips.
[27:3] A stone `is' heavy, and the sand `is' heavy, And the anger of a fool Is heavier than they both.
[27:4] Fury `is' fierce, and anger `is' overflowing, And who standeth before jealousy?
[27:5] Better `is' open reproof than hidden love.
[27:6] Faithful are the wounds of a lover, And abundant the kisses of an enemy.
[27:7] A satiated soul treadeth down a honeycomb, And `to' a hungry soul every bitter thing `is' sweet.
[27:8] As a bird wandering from her nest, So `is' a man wandering from his place.
[27:9] Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart, And the sweetness of one's friend -- from counsel of the soul.
[27:10] Thine own friend, and the friend of thy father, forsake not, And the house of thy brother enter not In a day of thy calamity, Better `is' a near neighbour than a brother afar off.
[27:11] Be wise, my son, and rejoice my heart. And I return my reproacher a word.
[27:12] The prudent hath seen the evil, he is hidden, The simple have passed on, they are punished.
[27:13] Take his garment, when a stranger hath been surety, And for a strange woman pledge it.
[27:14] Whoso is saluting his friend with a loud voice, In the morning rising early, A light thing it is reckoned to him.
[27:15] A continual dropping in a day of rain, And a woman of contentions are alike,
[27:16] Whoso is hiding her hath hidden the wind, And the ointment of his right hand calleth out.
[27:17] Iron by iron is sharpened, And a man sharpens the face of his friend.
[27:18] The keeper of a fig-tree eateth its fruit, And the preserver of his master is honoured.
[27:19] As `in' water the face `is' to face, So the heart of man to man.
[27:20] Sheol and destruction are not satisfied, And the eyes of man are not satisfied.
[27:21] A refining pot `is' for silver, and a furnace for gold, And a man according to his praise.
[27:22] If thou dost beat the foolish in a mortar, Among washed things -- with a pestle, His folly turneth not aside from off him.
[27:23] Know well the face of thy flock, Set thy heart to the droves,
[27:24] For riches `are' not to the age, Nor a crown to generation and generation.
[27:25] Revealed was the hay, and seen the tender grass, And gathered the herbs of mountains.
[27:26] Lambs `are' for thy clothing, And the price of the field `are' he-goats,
[27:27] And a sufficiency of goats' milk `is' for thy bread, For bread to thy house, and life to thy damsels!
[28:1] The wicked have fled and there is no pursuer. And the righteous as a young lion is confident.
[28:2] By the transgression of a land many `are' its heads. And by an intelligent man, Who knoweth right -- it is prolonged.
[28:3] A man -- poor and oppressing the weak, `Is' a sweeping rain, and there is no bread.
[28:4] Those forsaking the law praise the wicked, Those keeping the law plead against them.
[28:5] Evil men understand not judgment, And those seeking Jehovah understand all.
[28:6] Better `is' the poor walking in his integrity, Than the perverse of ways who is rich.
[28:7] Whoso is keeping the law is an intelligent son, And a friend of gluttons, Doth cause his father to blush.
[28:8] Whoso is multiplying his wealth by biting and usury, For one favouring the poor doth gather it.
[28:9] Whoso is turning his ear from hearing the law, Even his prayer `is' an abomination.
[28:10] Whoso is causing the upright to err in an evil way, Into his own pit he doth fall, And the perfect do inherit good.
[28:11] A rich man is wise in his own eyes, And the intelligent poor searcheth him.
[28:12] In the exulting of the righteous the glory `is' abundant, And in the rising of the wicked man is apprehensive.
[28:13] Whoso is covering his transgressions prospereth not, And he who is confessing and forsaking hath mercy.
[28:14] O the happiness of a man fearing continually, And whoso is hardening his heart falleth into evil.
[28:15] A growling lion, and a ranging bear, `Is' the wicked ruler over a poor people.
[28:16] A leader lacking understanding multiplieth oppressions, Whoso is hating dishonest gain prolongeth days.
[28:17] A man oppressed with the blood of a soul, Unto the pit fleeth, none taketh hold on him.
[28:18] Whoso is walking uprightly is saved, And the perverted of ways falleth at once.
[28:19] Whoso is tilling his ground is satisfied `with' bread, And whoso is pursuing vanity, Is filled `with' poverty.
[28:20] A stedfast man hath multiplied blessings, And whoso is hasting to be rich is not acquitted.
[28:21] To discern faces is not good, And for a piece of bread doth a man transgress.
[28:22] Troubled for wealth `is' the man `with' an evil eye, And he knoweth not that want doth meet him.
[28:23] Whoso is reproving a man afterwards findeth grace, More than a flatterer with the tongue.
[28:24] Whoso is robbing his father, or his mother, And is saying, `It is not transgression,' A companion he is to a destroyer.
[28:25] Whoso is proud in soul stirreth up contention, And whoso is trusting on Jehovah is made fat.
[28:26] Whoso is trusting in his heart is a fool, And whoso is walking in wisdom is delivered.
[28:27] Whoso is giving to the poor hath no lack, And whoso is hiding his eyes multiplied curses.
[28:28] In the rising of the wicked a man is hidden, And in their destruction the righteous multiply!
[29:1] A man often reproved, hardening the neck, Is suddenly broken, and there is no healing.
[29:2] In the multiplying of the righteous the people rejoice, And in the ruling of the wicked the people sigh.
[29:3] A man loving wisdom rejoiceth his father, And a friend of harlots destroyeth wealth.
[29:4] A king by judgment establisheth a land, And one receiving gifts throweth it down.
[29:5] A man taking a portion above his neighbour, Spreadeth a net for his own steps.
[29:6] In the transgression of the evil `is' a snare, And the righteous doth sing and rejoice.
[29:7] The righteous knoweth the plea of the poor, The wicked understandeth not knowledge.
[29:8] Men of scorning ensnare a city, And the wise turn back anger.
[29:9] A wise man is judged by the foolish man, And he hath been angry, And he hath laughed, and there is no rest.
[29:10] Men of blood hate the perfect, And the upright seek his soul.
[29:11] A fool bringeth out all his mind, And the wise till afterwards restraineth it.
[29:12] A ruler who is attending to lying words, All his ministers `are' wicked.
[29:13] The poor and the man of frauds have met together, Jehovah is enlightening the eyes of them both.
[29:14] a king that is judging truly the poor, His throne for ever is established.
[29:15] A rod and reproof give wisdom, And a youth let away is shaming his mother.
[29:16] In the multiplying of the wicked transgression multiplieth, And the righteous on their fall do look.
[29:17] Chastise thy son, and he giveth thee comfort, Yea, he giveth delights to thy soul.
[29:18] Without a Vision is a people made naked, And whoso is keeping the law, O his happiness!
[29:19] By words a servant is not instructed though he understand, And there is nothing answering.
[29:20] Thou hast seen a man hasty in his words! More hope of a fool than of him.
[29:21] Whoso is bringing up his servant delicately, from youth, `At' his latter end also he is continuator.
[29:22] An angry man stirreth up contention, And a furious man is multiplying transgression.
[29:23] The pride of man humbleth him, And humility of spirit upholdeth honour.
[29:24] Whoso is sharing with a thief is hating his own soul, Execration he heareth, and telleth not.
[29:25] Fear of man causeth a snare, And the confident in Jehovah is set on high.
[29:26] Many are seeking the face of a ruler, And from Jehovah `is' the judgment of each.
[29:27] An abomination to the righteous `is' the perverse man, And an abomination to the wicked `is' the upright in the way!
[30:1] Words of a Gatherer, son of an obedient one, the declaration, an affirmation of the man: -- I have wearied myself `for' God, I have wearied myself `for' God, and am consumed.
[30:2] For I am more brutish than any one, And have not the understanding of a man.
[30:3] Nor have I learned wisdom, Yet the knowledge of Holy Ones I know.
[30:4] Who went up to heaven, and cometh down? Who hath gathered the wind in his fists? Who hath bound waters in a garment? Who established all ends of the earth? What `is' His name? and what His son's name? Surely thou knowest!
[30:5] Every saying of God `is' tried, A shield He `is' to those trusting in Him.
[30:6] Add not to His words, lest He reason with thee, And thou hast been found false.
[30:7] Two things I have asked from Thee, Withhold not from me before I die.
[30:8] Vanity and a lying word put far from me, Poverty or wealth give not to me, Cause me to eat the bread of my portion,
[30:9] Lest I become satiated, and have denied, And have said, `Who `is' Jehovah?' And lest I be poor, and have stolen, And have laid hold of the name of my God.
[30:10] Accuse not a servant unto his lord, Lest he disesteem thee, and thou be found guilty.
[30:11] A generation `is', that lightly esteemeth their father, And their mother doth not bless.
[30:12] A generation -- pure in their own eyes, But from their own filth not washed.
[30:13] A generation -- how high are their eyes, Yea, their eyelids are lifted up.
[30:14] A generation -- swords `are' their teeth, And knives -- their jaw-teeth, To consume the poor from earth, And the needy from `among' men.
[30:15] To the leech `are' two daughters, `Give, give, Lo, three things are not satisfied, Four have not said `Sufficiency;'
[30:16] Sheol, and a restrained womb, Earth -- it `is' not satisfied `with' water, And fire -- it hath not said, `Sufficiency,'
[30:17] An eye that mocketh at a father, And despiseth to obey a mother, Dig it out do ravens of the valley, And eat it do young eagles.
[30:18] Three things have been too wonderful for me, Yea, four that I have not known:
[30:19] The way of the eagle in the heavens, The way of a serpent on a rock, The way of a ship in the heart of the sea, And the way of a man in youth.
[30:20] So -- the way of an adulterous woman, She hath eaten and hath wiped her mouth, And hath said, `I have not done iniquity.'
[30:21] For three things hath earth been troubled, And for four -- it is not able to bear:
[30:22] For a servant when he reigneth, And a fool when he is satisfied with bread,
[30:23] For a hated one when she ruleth, And a maid-servant when she succeedeth her mistress.
[30:24] Four `are' little ones of earth, And they are made wiser than the wise:
[30:25] The ants `are' a people not strong, And they prepare in summer their food,
[30:26] Conies `are' a people not strong, And they place in a rock their house,
[30:27] A king there is not to the locust, And it goeth out -- each one shouting,
[30:28] A spider with two hands taketh hold, And is in the palaces of a king.
[30:29] Three there are going well, Yea, four are good in going:
[30:30] An old lion -- mighty among beasts, That turneth not back from the face of any,
[30:31] A girt one of the loins, or a he-goat, And a king -- no rising up with him.
[30:32] If thou hast been foolish in lifting up thyself, And if thou hast devised evil -- hand to mouth!
[30:33] For the churning of milk bringeth out butter, And the wringing of the nose bringeth out blood, And the forcing of anger bringeth out strife!
[31:1] Words of Lemuel a king, a declaration that his mother taught him:
[31:2] `What, my son? and what, son of my womb? And what, son of my vows?
[31:3] Give not to women thy strength, And thy ways to wiping away of kings.
[31:4] Not for kings, O Lemuel, Not for kings, to drink wine, And for princes a desire of strong drink.
[31:5] Lest he drink, and forget the decree, And change the judgment of any of the sons of affliction.
[31:6] Give strong drink to the perishing, And wine to the bitter in soul,
[31:7] He drinketh, and forgetteth his poverty, And his misery he remembereth not again.
[31:8] Open thy mouth for the dumb, For the right of all sons of change.
[31:9] Open thy mouth, judge righteously, Both the cause of the poor and needy!'
[31:10] A woman of worth who doth find? Yea, far above rubies `is' her price.
[31:11] The heart of her husband hath trusted in her, And spoil he lacketh not.
[31:12] She hath done him good, and not evil, All days of her life.
[31:13] She hath sought wool and flax, And with delight she worketh `with' her hands.
[31:14] She hath been as ships of the merchant, From afar she bringeth in her bread.
[31:15] Yea, she riseth while yet night, And giveth food to her household, And a portion to her damsels.
[31:16] She hath considered a field, and taketh it, From the fruit of her hands she hath planted a vineyard.
[31:17] She hath girded with might her loins, And doth strengthen her arms.
[31:18] She hath perceived when her merchandise `is' good, Her lamp is not extinguished in the night.
[31:19] Her hands she hath sent forth on a spindle, And her hands have held a distaff.
[31:20] Her hand she hath spread forth to the poor, Yea, her hands she sent forth to the needy.
[31:21] She is not afraid of her household from snow, For all her household are clothed `with' scarlet.
[31:22] Ornamental coverings she hath made for herself, Silk and purple `are' her clothing.
[31:23] Known in the gates is her husband, In his sitting with elders of the land.
[31:24] Linen garments she hath made, and selleth, And a girdle she hath given to the merchant.
[31:25] Strength and honour `are' her clothing, And she rejoiceth at a latter day.
[31:26] Her mouth she hath opened in wisdom, And the law of kindness `is' on her tongue.
[31:27] She `is' watching the ways of her household, And bread of sloth she eateth not.
[31:28] Her sons have risen up, and pronounce her happy, Her husband, and he praiseth her,
[31:29] `Many `are' the daughters who have done worthily, Thou hast gone up above them all.'
[31:30] The grace `is' false, and the beauty `is' vain, A woman fearing Jehovah, she may boast herself.
[31:31] Give ye to her of the fruit of her hands, And her works do praise her in the gates!
