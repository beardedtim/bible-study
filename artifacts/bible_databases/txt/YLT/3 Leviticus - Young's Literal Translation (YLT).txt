Leviticus - Young's Literal Translation (YLT)
[1:1] And Jehovah calleth unto Moses, and speaketh unto him out of the tent of meeting, saying,
[1:2] `Speak unto the sons of Israel, and thou hast said unto them, Any man of you when he doth bring near an offering to Jehovah, out of the cattle -- out of the herd, or out of the flock -- ye do bring near your offering.
[1:3] `If his offering `is' a burnt-offering out of the herd -- a male, a perfect one, he doth bring near, unto the opening of the tent of meeting he doth bring it near, at his pleasure, before Jehovah;
[1:4] and he hath laid his hand on the head of the burnt-offering, and it hath been accepted for him to make atonement for him;
[1:5] and he hath slaughtered the son of the herd before Jehovah; and sons of Aaron, the priests, have brought the blood near, and sprinkled the blood on the altar round about, which `is' at the opening of the tent of meeting.
[1:6] `And he hath stripped the burnt-offering, and hath cut it into its pieces;
[1:7] and the sons of Aaron the priest have put fire on the altar, and arranged wood on the fire;
[1:8] and sons of Aaron, the priests, have arranged the pieces, with the head and the fat, on the wood, which `is' on the fire, which `is' on the altar;
[1:9] and its inwards and its legs he doth wash with water; and the priest hath made perfume with the whole on the altar, a burnt-offering, a fire-offering of sweet fragrance to Jehovah.
[1:10] `And if his offering `is' out of the flock -- out of the sheep or out of the goats -- for a burnt-offering, a male, a perfect one, he doth bring near,
[1:11] and he hath slaughtered it by the side of the altar northward, before Jehovah; and sons of Aaron, the priests, have sprinkled its blood on the altar round about;
[1:12] and he hath cut it into its pieces, and its head and its fat, and the priest hath arranged them on the wood, which `is' on the fire, which `is' on the altar;
[1:13] and the inwards and the legs he doth wash with water, and the priest hath brought the whole near, and hath made perfume on the altar; it `is' a burnt-offering, a fire-offering of sweet fragrance to Jehovah.
[1:14] `And if his offering `is' a burnt-offering out of the fowl to Jehovah, than he hath brought near his offering out of the turtle-doves or out of the young pigeons,
[1:15] and the priest hath brought it near unto the altar, and hath wrung off its head, and hath made perfume on the altar, and its blood hath been wrung out by the side of the altar;
[1:16] and he hath turned aside its crop with its feathers, and hath cast it near the altar, eastward, unto the place of ashes;
[1:17] and he hath cleaved it with its wings (he doth not separate `it'), and the priest hath made it a perfume on the altar, on the wood, which `is' on the fire; it `is' a burnt-offering, a fire-offering of sweet fragrance to Jehovah.
[2:1] `And when a person bringeth near an offering, a present to Jehovah, of flour is his offering, and he hath poured on it oil, and hath put on it frankincense;
[2:2] and he hath brought it in unto the sons of Aaron, the priests, and he hath taken from thence the fulness of his hand of its flour and of its oil, besides all its frankincense, and the priest hath made perfume with its memorial on the altar, a fire-offering of sweet fragrance to Jehovah;
[2:3] and the remnant of the present `is' for Aaron and for his sons, most holy, of the fire-offerings of Jehovah.
[2:4] `And when thou bringest near an offering, a present baked in an oven, `it is of' unleavened cakes of flour mixed with oil, or thin unleavened cakes anointed with oil.
[2:5] `And if thine offering `is' a present `made' on the girdel, it is of flour, mixed with oil, unleavened;
[2:6] divide thou it into parts, and thou hast poured on it oil; it `is' a present.
[2:7] `And if thine offering `is' a present `made' on the frying-pan, of flour with oil it is made,
[2:8] and thou hast brought in the present which is made of these to Jehovah, and `one' hath brought it near unto the priest, and he hath brought it nigh unto the altar,
[2:9] and the priest hath lifted up from the present its memorial, and hath made perfume on the altar, a fire-offering of sweet fragrance to Jehovah;
[2:10] and the remnant of the present `is' for Aaron and for his sons, most holy, of the fire-offerings of Jehovah.
[2:11] No present which ye bring near to Jehovah is made fermented, for with any leaven or any honey ye perfume no fire-offering to Jehovah.
[2:12] `An offering of first-`fruits' -- ye bring them near to Jehovah, but on the altar they go not up, for sweet fragrance.
[2:13] And every offering -- thy present -- with salt thou dost season, and thou dost not let the salt of the covenant of thy God cease from thy present; with all thine offerings thou dost bring near salt.
[2:14] `And if thou bring near a present of first-ripe `fruits' to Jehovah, -- of green ears, roasted with fire, beaten out `corn' of a fruitful field thou dost bring near the present of thy first-ripe `fruits',
[2:15] and thou hast put on it oil, and laid on it frankincense, it `is' a present;
[2:16] and the priest hath made perfume with its memorial from its beaten out `corn', and from its oil, besides all its frankincense -- a fire-offering to Jehovah.
[3:1] `And if his offering `is' a sacrifice of peace-offerings, if out of the herd he is bringing near, whether male or female, a perfect one he doth bring near before Jehovah,
[3:2] and he hath laid his hand on the head of his offering, and hath slaughtered it at the opening of the tent of meeting, and sons of Aaron, the priests, have sprinkled the blood on the altar round about.
[3:3] `And he hath brought near from the sacrifice of the peace-offerings a fire-offering to Jehovah, the fat which is covering the inwards, and all the fat which `is' on the inwards,
[3:4] and the two kidneys, and the fat which `is' on them, which `is' on the flanks, and the redundance above the liver, (beside the kidneys he doth turn it aside),
[3:5] and sons of Aaron have made it a perfume on the altar, on the burnt-offering which `is' on the wood, which `is' on the fire -- a fire-offering of sweet fragrance to Jehovah.
[3:6] `And if his offering `is' out of the flock for a sacrifice of peace-offerings to Jehovah, male or female, a perfect one he doth bring near;
[3:7] if a sheep he is bringing near `for' his offering, then he hath brought it near before Jehovah,
[3:8] and hath laid his hand on the head of his offering, and hath slaughtered it before the tent of meeting, and sons of Aaron have sprinkled its blood on the altar round about.
[3:9] `And he hath brought near from the sacrifice of the peace-offerings a fire-offering to Jehovah, its fat, the whole fat tail (over-against the bone he doth turn it aside), and the fat which is covering the inwards, and all the fat which `is' on the inwards,
[3:10] and the two kidneys, and the fat which `is' on them, which `is' on the flanks, and the redundance above the liver, (beside the kidneys he doth turn it aside),
[3:11] and the priest hath made it a perfume on the altar -- bread of a fire-offering to Jehovah.
[3:12] `And if his offering `is' a goat, then he hath brought it near before Jehovah,
[3:13] and hath laid his hand on its head, and hath slaughtered it before the tent of meeting, and sons of Aaron have sprinkled its blood on the altar round about;
[3:14] and he hath brought near from it his offering, a fire-offering to Jehovah, the fat which is covering the inwards, and all the fat which `is' on the inwards,
[3:15] and the two kidneys, and the fat which `is' upon them, which `is' on the flanks, and the redundance above the liver, (beside the kidneys he doth turn it aside),
[3:16] and the priest hath made them a perfume on the altar -- bread of a fire-offering, for sweet fragrance; all the fat `is' Jehovah's.
[3:17] `A statute age-during to your generations in all your dwellings: any fat or any blood ye do not eat.'
[4:1] And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,
[4:2] `Speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, When a person doth sin through ignorance against any of the commands of Jehovah `regarding things' which are not to be done, and hath done `something' against one of these --
[4:3] `If the priest who is anointed doth sin according to the guilt of the people, then he hath brought near for his sin which he hath sinned a bullock, a son of the herd, a perfect one, to Jehovah, for a sin-offering,
[4:4] and he hath brought in the bullock unto the opening of the tent of meeting before Jehovah, and hath laid his hand on the head of the bullock, and hath slaughtered the bullock before Jehovah.
[4:5] `And the priest who is anointed hath taken of the blood of the bullock, and hath brought it in unto the tent of meeting,
[4:6] and the priest hath dipped his finger in the blood, and sprinkled of the blood seven times before Jehovah, at the front of the vail of the sanctuary;
[4:7] and the priest hath put of the blood on the horns of the altar of spice-perfume before Jehovah, which `is' in the tent of meeting, and all the blood of the bullock he doth pour out at the foundation of the altar of the burnt-offering, which `is' at the opening of the tent of meeting.
[4:8] `And all the fat of the bullock of the sin-offering he doth lift up from it, the fat which is covering over the inwards, and all the fat which `is' on the inwards,
[4:9] and the two kidneys, and the fat which `is' on them, which `is' on the flanks, and the redundance above the liver, (beside the kidneys he doth turn it aside),
[4:10] as it is lifted up from the ox of the sacrifice of the peace-offerings; and the priest hath made them a perfume on the altar of the burnt-offering.
[4:11] `And the skin of the bullock, and all its flesh, besides its head, and besides its legs, and its inwards, and its dung --
[4:12] he hath even brought out the whole bullock unto the outside of the camp, unto a clean place, unto the place of the pouring out of the ashes, and he hath burnt it on the wood with fire; beside the place of the pouring out of the ashes it is burnt.
[4:13] `And if the whole company of Israel err ignorantly, and the thing hath been hidden from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done `something against' one of all the commands of Jehovah `concerning things' which are not to be done, and have been guilty;
[4:14] when the sin which they have sinned concerning it hath been known, then have the assembly brought near a bullock, a son of the herd, for a sin-offering, and they have brought it in before the tent of meeting;
[4:15] and the elders of the company have laid their hands on the head of the bullock, before Jehovah, and `one' hath slaughtered the bullock before Jehovah.
[4:16] `And the priest who is anointed hath brought in of the blood of the bullock unto the tent of meeting,
[4:17] and the priest hath dipped his finger in the blood, and hath sprinkled seven times before Jehovah at the front of the vail,
[4:18] and `some' of the blood he doth put on the horns of the altar which `is' before Jehovah, which `is' in the tent of meeting; and all the blood he doth pour out at the foundation of the altar of the burnt-offering, which `is' at the opening of the tent of meeting;
[4:19] and all its fat he doth lift up from it, and hath made perfume on the altar.
[4:20] `And he hath done to the bullock as he hath done to the bullock of the sin-offering, so he doth to it; and the priest hath made atonement for them, and it hath been forgiven them;
[4:21] and he hath brought out the bullock unto the outside of the camp, and hath burned it as he hath burned the first bullock; it `is' a sin-offering of the assembly.
[4:22] `When a prince doth sin, and hath done `something against' one of all the commands of Jehovah his God `regarding things' which are not to be done, through ignorance, and hath been guilty --
[4:23] or his sin wherein he hath sinned hath been made known unto him, then he hath brought in his offering, a kid of the goats, a male, a perfect one,
[4:24] and he hath laid his hand on the head of the goat, and hath slaughtered it in the place where he doth slaughter the burnt-offering before Jehovah; it `is' a sin-offering.
[4:25] `And the priest hath taken of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, and hath put on the horns of the altar of the burnt-offering, and its blood he doth pour out at the foundation of the altar of the burnt-offering,
[4:26] and with all its fat he doth make perfume on the altar, as the fat of the sacrifice of the peace-offerings; and the priest hath made atonement for him because of his sin, and it hath been forgiven him.
[4:27] `And if any person of the people of the land sin through ignorance, by his doing `something against' one of the commands of Jehovah `regarding things' which are not to be done, and hath been guilty --
[4:28] or his sin which he hath sinned hath been made known unto him, then he hath brought in his offering, a kid of the goats, a perfect one, a female, for his sin which he hath sinned,
[4:29] and he hath laid his hand on the head of the sin-offering, and hath slaughtered the sin-offering in the place of the burnt-offering.
[4:30] `And the priest hath taken of its blood with his finger, and hath put on the horns of the altar of the burnt-offering, and all its blood he doth pour out at the foundation of the altar,
[4:31] and all its fat he doth turn aside, as the fat hath been turned aside from off the sacrifice of the peace-offerings, and the priest hath made perfume on the altar, for sweet fragrance to Jehovah; and the priest hath made atonement for him, and it hath been forgiven him.
[4:32] `And if he bring in a sheep `for' his offering, for a sin-offering, a female, a perfect one, he doth bring in,
[4:33] and he hath laid his hand on the head of the sin-offering, and hath slaughtered it for a sin-offering in the place where he slaughtereth the burnt-offering.
[4:34] `And the priest hath taken of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, and hath put on the horns of the altar of the burnt-offering, and all its blood he poureth out at the foundation of the altar,
[4:35] and all its fat he turneth aside, as the fat of the sheep is turned aside from the sacrifice of the peace-offerings, and the priest hath made them a perfume on the altar, according to the fire-offerings of Jehovah, and the priest hath made atonement for him, for his sin which he hath sinned, and it hath been forgiven him.
[5:1] `And when a person doth sin, and hath heard the voice of an oath, and he `is' witness, or hath seen, or hath known -- if he declare not, then he hath borne his iniquity:
[5:2] `Or when a person cometh against any thing unclean, or against a carcase of an unclean beast, or against a carcase of unclean cattle, or against a carcase of an unclean teeming creature, and it hath been hidden from him, and he unclean, and guilty;
[5:3] `Or when he cometh against uncleanness of man, even any of his uncleanness whereby he is unclean, and it hath been hidden from him, and he hath known, and hath been guilty:
[5:4] `Or when a person sweareth, speaking wrongfully with the lips to do evil, or to do good, even anything which man speaketh wrongfully with an oath, and it hath been hid from him; -- when he hath known then he hath been guilty of one of these;
[5:5] `And it hath been when he is guilty of one of these, that he hath confessed concerning that which he hath sinned,
[5:6] and hath brought in his guilt-offering to Jehovah for his sin which he hath sinned, a female out of the flock, a lamb, or a kid of the goats, for a sin-offering, and the priest hath made atonement for him, because of his sin.
[5:7] `And if his hand reach not to the sufficiency of a lamb, then he hath brought in his guilt-offering -- he who hath sinned -- two turtle-doves or two young pigeons to Jehovah, one for a sin-offering, and one for a burnt-offering;
[5:8] and he hath brought them in unto the priest, and hath brought near that which `is' for a sin-offering first, and hath wrung off its head from its neck, and doth not separate `it',
[5:9] and he hath sprinkled of the blood of the sin-offering on the side of the altar, and that which is left of the blood is wrung out at the foundation of the altar; it `is' a sin-offering.
[5:10] `And the second he maketh a burnt-offering, according to the ordinance, and the priest hath made atonement for him, because of his sin which he hath sinned, and it hath been forgiven him.
[5:11] `And if his hand reach not to two turtle-doves, or to two young pigeons, then he hath brought in his offering -- he who hath sinned -- a tenth of an ephah of flour for a sin-offering; he putteth no oil on it, nor doth he put on it frankincense, for it `is' a sin-offering,
[5:12] and he hath brought it in unto the priest, and the priest hath taken a handful from it -- the fulness of his hand -- its memorial -- and hath made perfume on the altar, according to the fire-offerings of Jehovah; it `is' a sin-offering.
[5:13] `And the priest hath made atonement for him, for his sin which he hath sinned against one of these, and it hath been forgiven him, and `the remnant' hath been to the priest, like the present.'
[5:14] And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,
[5:15] `When a person committeth a trespass, and hath sinned through ignorance against the holy things of Jehovah, then he hath brought in his guilt-offering to Jehovah, a ram, a perfect one, out of the flock, at thy valuation `in' silver -- shekels by the shekel of the sanctuary -- for a guilt-offering.
[5:16] `And that which he hath sinned against the holy thing he repayeth, and its fifth is adding to it, and hath given it to the priest, and the priest maketh atonement for him with the ram of the guilt-offering, and it hath been forgiven him.
[5:17] `And when any person sinneth, and hath done `something against' one of all the commands of Jehovah `regarding things' which are not to be done, and hath not known, and he hath been guilty, and hath borne his iniquity,
[5:18] `Then he hath brought in a ram, a perfect one, out of the flock, at thy valuation, for a guilt-offering, unto the priest; and the priest hath made atonement for him, for his ignorance in which he hath erred and he hath not known, and it hath been forgiven him;
[5:19] it `is' a guilt-offering; he hath been certainly guilty before Jehovah.'
[6:1] And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,
[6:2] `When any person doth sin, and hath committed a trespass against Jehovah, and hath lied to his fellow concerning a deposit, or concerning fellowship, or concerning violent robbery, or hath oppressed his fellow;
[6:3] or hath found a lost thing, and hath lied concerning it, and hath sworn to a falsehood, concerning one of all `these' which man doth, sinning in them:
[6:4] `Then it hath been, when he sinneth, and hath been guilty, that he hath returned the plunder which he hath taken violently away, or the thing which he hath got by oppression, or the deposit which hath been deposited with him, or the lost thing which he hath found;
[6:5] or all that concerning which he sweareth falsely, he hath even repaid it in its principal, and its fifth he is adding to it; to him whose it `is' he giveth it in the day of his guilt-offering.
[6:6] `And his guilt-offering he bringeth in to Jehovah, a ram, a perfect one, out of the flock, at thy estimation, for a guilt-offering, unto the priest,
[6:7] and the priest hath made atonement for him before Jehovah, and it hath been forgiven him, concerning one thing of all that he doth, by being guilty therein.'
[6:8] And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,
[6:9] `Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This `is' a law of the burnt-offering (it `is' the burnt-offering, because of the burning on the altar all the night unto the morning, and the fire of the altar is burning on it,)
[6:10] that the priest hath put on his long robe of fine linen, and his fine linen trousers he doth put on his flesh, and hath lifted up the ashes which the fire consumeth with the burnt-offering on the altar, and hath put them near the altar;
[6:11] and he hath stripped off his garments, and hath put on other garments, and hath brought out the ashes unto the outside of the camp, unto a clean place.
[6:12] `And the fire on the altar is burning on it, it is not quenched, and the priest hath burned on it wood morning by morning, and hath arranged on it the burnt-offering, and hath made perfume on it `with' the fat of the peace-offerings;
[6:13] fire is continually burning on the altar, it is not quenched.
[6:14] `And this `is' a law of the present: sons of Aaron have brought it near before Jehovah unto the front of the altar,
[6:15] and `one' hath lifted up of it with his hand from the flour of the present, and from its oil, and all the frankincense which `is' on the present, and hath made perfume on the altar, sweet fragrance -- its memorial to Jehovah.
[6:16] `And the remnant of it do Aaron and his sons eat; `with' unleavened things it is eaten, in the holy place, in the court of the tent of meeting they do eat it.
[6:17] It is not baken `with' any thing fermented, their portion I have given it, out of My fire-offerings; it `is' most holy, like the sin-offering, and like the guilt-offering.
[6:18] Every male among the sons of Aaron doth eat it -- a statute age-during to your generations, out of the fire-offerings of Jehovah: all that cometh against them is holy.'
[6:19] And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,
[6:20] `This `is' an offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they bring near to Jehovah in the day of his being anointed; a tenth of the ephah of flour `for' a continual present, half of it in the morning, and half of it in the evening;
[6:21] on a girdel with oil it is made -- fried thou dost bring it in; baked pieces of the present thou dost bring near, a sweet fragrance to Jehovah.
[6:22] `And the priest who is anointed in his stead, from among his sons, doth make it, -- a statute age-during of Jehovah: it is completely perfumed;
[6:23] and every present of a priest is a whole burnt-offering; it is not eaten.'
[6:24] And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,
[6:25] `Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying, This `is' a law of the sin-offering: in the place where the burnt-offering is slaughtered is the sin-offering slaughtered before Jehovah; it `is' most holy.
[6:26] `The priest who is making atonement with it doth eat it, in the holy place it is eaten, in the court of the tent of meeting;
[6:27] all that cometh against its flesh is holy, and when `any' of its blood is sprinkled on the garment, that on which it is sprinkled thou dost wash in the holy place;
[6:28] and an earthen vessel in which it is boiled is broken, and if in a brass vessel it is boiled, then it is scoured and rinsed with water.
[6:29] `Every male among the priests doth eat it -- it `is' most holy;
[6:30] and no sin-offering, `any' of whose blood is brought in unto the tent of meeting to make atonement in the sanctuary is eaten; with fire it is burnt.
[7:1] `And this `is' a law of the guilt-offering: it `is' most holy;
[7:2] in the place where they slaughter the burnt-offering they do slaughter the guilt-offering, and its blood `one' doth sprinkle on the altar round about,
[7:3] and all its fat he bringeth near out of it, the fat tail, and the fat which is covering the inwards,
[7:4] and the two kidneys, and the fat which `is' on them, which `is' on the flanks, and the redundance above the liver (beside the kidneys he doth turn it aside);
[7:5] and the priest hath made them a perfume on the altar, a fire-offering to Jehovah; it `is' a guilt-offering.
[7:6] `Every male among the priests doth eat it; in the holy place it is eaten -- it `is' most holy;
[7:7] as `is' a sin-offering, so `is' a guilt-offering; one law `is' for them; the priest who maketh atonement by it -- it is his.
[7:8] `And the priest who is bringing near any man's burnt-offering, the skin of the burnt-offering which he hath brought near, it is the priest's, his own;
[7:9] and every present which is baked in an oven, and every one done in a frying-pan, and on a girdel, `is' the priest's who is bringing it near; it is his;
[7:10] and every present, mixed with oil or dry, is for all the sons of Aaron -- one as another.
[7:11] `And this `is' a law of the sacrifice of the peace-offerings which `one' bringeth near to Jehovah:
[7:12] if for a thank-offering he bring it near, then he hath brought near with the sacrifice of thank-offering unleavened cakes mixed with oil, and thin unleavened cakes anointed with oil, and of fried flour cakes mixed with oil;
[7:13] besides the cakes, fermented bread he doth bring near `with' his offering, besides the sacrifice of thank-offering of his peace-offerings;
[7:14] and he hath brought near out of it one of the whole offering -- a heave-offering to Jehovah; to the priest who is sprinkling the blood of the peace-offerings -- it is his;
[7:15] as to the flesh of the sacrifice of the thank-offering of his peace-offerings, in the day of his offering it is eaten; he doth not leave of it till morning.
[7:16] `And if the sacrifice of his offering `is' a vow or free-will offering, in the day of his bringing near his sacrifice it is eaten; and on the morrow also the remnant of it is eaten;
[7:17] and the remnant of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day with fire is burnt;
[7:18] and if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings be really eaten on the third day, it is not pleasing; for him who is bringing it near it is not reckoned; it is an abominable thing, and the person who is eating of it his iniquity doth bear.
[7:19] `And the flesh which cometh against any unclean thing is not eaten; with fire it is burnt; as to the flesh, every clean one doth eat of the flesh;
[7:20] and the person who eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of the peace-offerings which `are' Jehovah's, and his uncleanness upon him, even that person hath been cut off from his people.
[7:21] `And when a person cometh against any thing unclean, of the uncleanness of man, or of the uncleanness of beasts, or of any unclean teeming creature, and hath eaten of the flesh of the sacrifice of the peace-offerings which `are' Jehovah's, even that person hath been cut off from his people.'
[7:22] And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,
[7:23] `Speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, Any fat of ox and sheep and goat ye do not eat;
[7:24] and the fat of a carcase, and the fat of a torn thing is prepared for any work, but ye do certainly not eat it;
[7:25] for whoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which `one' bringeth near a fire-offering to Jehovah, even the person who eateth hath been cut off from his people.
[7:26] `And any blood ye do not eat in all your dwellings, of fowl, or of beast;
[7:27] any person who eateth any blood, even that person hath been cut off from his people.'
[7:28] And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,
[7:29] `Speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, He who is bringing near the sacrifice of his peace-offerings to Jehovah doth bring in his offering to Jehovah from the sacrifice of his peace-offerings;
[7:30] his own hands do bring in the fire-offerings of Jehovah, the fat beside the breast, it he doth bring in with the breast, to wave it -- a wave-offering before Jehovah.
[7:31] `And the priest hath made perfume with the fat on the altar, and the breast hath been Aaron's and his sons;
[7:32] and the right leg ye do make a heave-offering to the priest of the sacrifices of your peace-offerings;
[7:33] he of the sons of Aaron who is bringing near the blood of the peace-offerings, and the fat, his is the right leg for a portion.
[7:34] `For the breast of the wave-offering, and the leg of the heave-offering, I have taken from the sons of Israel, from the sacrifices of their peace-offerings, and I give them to Aaron the priest, and to his sons, by a statute age-during, from the sons of Israel.'
[7:35] This `is' the anointing of Aaron, and the anointing of his sons out of the fire-offerings of Jehovah, in the day he hath brought them near to act as priest to Jehovah,
[7:36] which Jehovah hath commanded to give to them in the day of His anointing them, from the sons of Israel -- a statute age-during to their generations.
[7:37] This `is' the law for burnt-offering, for present, and for sin-offering, and for guilt-offering, and for consecrations, and for a sacrifice of the peace-offerings,
[7:38] which Jehovah hath commanded Moses in Mount Sinai, in the day of his commanding the sons of Israel to bring near their offerings to Jehovah, in the wilderness of Sinai.
[8:1] And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,
[8:2] `Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and the bullock of the sin-offering, and the two rams, and the basket of unleavened things,
[8:3] and all the company assemble thou unto the opening of the tent of meeting.'
[8:4] And Moses doth as Jehovah hath commanded him, and the company is assembled unto the opening of the tent of meeting,
[8:5] and Moses saith unto the company, `This `is' the thing which Jehovah hath commanded to do.'
[8:6] And Moses bringeth near Aaron and his sons, and doth bathe them with water,
[8:7] and doth put on him the coat, and doth gird him with the girdle, and doth clothe him with the upper robe, and doth put on him the ephod, and doth gird him with the girdle of the ephod, and doth bind `it' to him with it,
[8:8] and doth put on him the breastplate, and doth put unto the breastplate the Lights and the Perfections,
[8:9] and doth put the mitre on his head, and doth put on the mitre, over-against its front, the golden flower of the holy crown, as Jehovah hath commanded Moses.
[8:10] And Moses taketh the anointing oil, and anointeth the tabernacle, and all that `is' in it, and sanctifieth them;
[8:11] and he sprinkleth of it on the altar seven times, and anointeth the altar, and all its vessels, and the laver, and its base, to sanctify them;
[8:12] and he poureth of the anointing oil on the head of Aaron, and anointeth him to sanctify him.
[8:13] And Moses bringeth near the sons of Aaron, and doth clothe them `with' coats, and girdeth them `with' girdles, and bindeth for them turbans, as Jehovah hath commanded Moses.
[8:14] And he bringeth nigh the bullock of the sin-offering, and Aaron layeth -- his sons also -- their hands on the head of the bullock of the sin-offering,
[8:15] and `one' slaughtereth, and Moses taketh the blood, and putteth on the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and cleanseth the altar, and the blood he hath poured out at the foundation of the altar, and sanctifieth it, to make atonement upon it.
[8:16] And he taketh all the fat that `is' on the inwards, and the redundance above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses maketh Perfume on the altar,
[8:17] and the bullock, and its skin, and its flesh, and its dung, he hath burnt with fire, at the outside of the camp, as Jehovah hath commanded Moses.
[8:18] And he bringeth near the ram of the burnt-offering, and Aaron and his sons lay their hands on the head of the ram,
[8:19] and `one' slaughtereth, and Moses sprinkleth the blood on the altar round about;
[8:20] and the ram he hath cut into its pieces, and Moses maketh perfume with the head, and the pieces, and the fat,
[8:21] and the inwards and the legs he hath washed with water, and Moses maketh perfume with the whole ram on the altar; it `is' a burnt-offering, for sweet fragrance; it `is' a fire-offering to Jehovah, as Jehovah hath commanded Moses.
[8:22] And he bringeth near the second ram, a ram of the consecrations, and Aaron and his sons lay their hands on the head of the ram,
[8:23] and `one' slaughtereth, and Moses taketh of its blood, and putteth on the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot;
[8:24] and he bringeth near the sons of Aaron, and Moses putteth of the blood on the tip of their right ear, and on the thumb of their right hand, and on the great toe of their right foot. And Moses sprinkleth the blood on the altar round about,
[8:25] and taketh the fat, and the fat tail, and all the fat that `is' on the inwards, and the redundance above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and the right leg;
[8:26] and out of the basket of unleavened things, which `is' before Jehovah, he hath taken one unleavened cake, and one cake of oiled bread, and one thin cake, and putteth `them' on the fat, and on the right leg;
[8:27] and putteth the whole on the hands of Aaron, and on the hands of his sons, and waveth them -- a wave-offering before Jehovah.
[8:28] And Moses taketh them from off their hands, and maketh perfume on the altar, on the burnt-offering, they `are' consecrations for sweet fragrance; it `is' a fire-offering to Jehovah;
[8:29] and Moses taketh the breast, and waveth it -- a wave-offering before Jehovah; of the ram of the consecrations it hath been to Moses for a portion, as Jehovah hath commanded Moses.
[8:30] And Moses taketh of the anointing oil, and of the blood which `is' on the altar, and sprinkleth on Aaron, on his garments, and on his sons, and on the garments of his sons with him, and he sanctifieth Aaron, his garments, and his sons, and the garments of his sons with him.
[8:31] And Moses saith unto Aaron, and unto his sons, `Boil ye the flesh at the opening of the tent of meeting, and there ye do eat it and the bread which `is' in the basket of the consecrations, as I have commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons do eat it.
[8:32] `And the remnant of the flesh and of the bread with fire ye burn;
[8:33] and from the opening of the tent of meeting ye go not out seven days, till the day of the fulness, the days of your consecration -- for seven days he doth consecrate your hand;
[8:34] as he hath done on this day, Jehovah hath commanded to do, to make atonement for you;
[8:35] and at the opening of the tent of meeting ye abide, by day and by night seven days, and ye have kept the charge of Jehovah, and die not, for so I have been commanded.'
[8:36] And Aaron doth -- his sons also -- all the things which Jehovah hath commanded by the hand of Moses.
[9:1] And it cometh to pass on the eighth day, Moses hath called for Aaron and for his sons, and for the elders of Israel,
[9:2] and he saith unto Aaron, `Take to thyself a calf, a son of the herd, for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering, perfect ones, and bring near before Jehovah.
[9:3] `And unto the sons of Israel thou dost speak, saying, Take ye a kid of the goats for a sin-offering, and a calf, and a lamb, sons of a year, perfect ones, for a burnt-offering,
[9:4] and a bullock and a ram for peace-offerings, to sacrifice before Jehovah, and a present mixed with oil; for to-day Jehovah hath appeared unto you.'
[9:5] And they take that which Moses hath commanded unto the front of the tent of meeting, and all the company draw near and stand before Jehovah;
[9:6] and Moses saith, `This `is' the thing which Jehovah hath commanded; do `it', and the honour of Jehovah doth appear unto you.'
[9:7] And Moses saith unto Aaron, `Draw near unto the altar, and make thy sin-offering, and thy burnt-offering, and make atonement for thyself, and for the people, and make the offering of the people, and make atonement for them, as Jehovah hath commanded.'
[9:8] And Aaron draweth near unto the altar, and slaughtereth the calf of the sin-offering, which `is' for himself;
[9:9] and the sons of Aaron bring the blood near unto him, and he dippeth his finger in the blood, and putteth `it' on the horns of the altar, and the blood he hath poured out at the foundation of the altar;
[9:10] and the fat, and the kidneys, and the redundance of the liver, of the sin-offering, he hath made a perfume on the altar, as Jehovah hath commanded Moses;
[9:11] and the flesh and the skin he hath burnt with fire, at the outside of the camp.
[9:12] And he slaughtereth the burnt-offering, and the sons of Aaron have presented unto him the blood, and he sprinkleth it on the altar round about;
[9:13] and the burnt-offering they have presented unto him, by its pieces, and the head, and he maketh perfume on the altar;
[9:14] and he washeth the inwards and the legs, and maketh perfume for the burnt-offering on the altar.
[9:15] And he bringeth near the offering of the people, and taketh the goat of the sin-offering which `is' for the people, and slaughtered it, and maketh it a sin-offering, like the first;
[9:16] and he bringeth near the burnt-offering, and maketh it, according to the ordinance;
[9:17] and he bringeth near the present, and filleth his palm with it, and maketh perfume on the altar, apart from the burnt-offering of the morning.
[9:18] And he slaughtereth the bullock and the ram, a sacrifice of the peace-offerings, which `are' for the people, and sons of Aaron present the blood unto him (and he sprinkleth it on the altar round about),
[9:19] and the fat of the bullock, and of the ram, the fat tail, and the covering `of the inwards', and the kidneys, and the redundance above the liver,
[9:20] and they set the fat on the breasts, and he maketh perfume with the fat on the altar;
[9:21] and the breasts, and the right leg hath Aaron waved -- a wave-offering before Jehovah, as He hath commanded Moses.
[9:22] And Aaron lifteth up his hand towards the people, and blesseth them, and cometh down from making the sin-offering, and the burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings.
[9:23] And Moses goeth in -- Aaron also -- unto the tent of meeting, and they come out, and bless the people, and the honour of Jehovah appeareth unto all the people;
[9:24] and fire cometh out from before Jehovah, and consumeth on the altar the burnt-offering, and the fat; and all the people see, and cry aloud, and fall on their faces.
[10:1] And the sons of Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, take each his censer, and put in them fire, and put on it perfume, and bring near before Jehovah strange fire, which He hath not commanded them;
[10:2] and fire goeth out from before Jehovah, and consumeth them, and they die before Jehovah.
[10:3] And Moses saith unto Aaron, `It `is' that which Jehovah hath spoken, saying, By those drawing near to Me I am sanctified, and in the face of all the people I am honoured;' and Aaron is silent.
[10:4] And Moses calleth unto Mishael and unto Elzaphan, sons of Uzziel, uncle of Aaron, and saith unto them, `Come near, bear your brethren from the front of the sanctuary unto the outside of the camp;'
[10:5] and they come near, and bear them in their coats unto the outside of the camp, as Moses hath spoken.
[10:6] And Moses saith unto Aaron, and to Eleazar, and to Ithamar his sons, `Your heads ye do not uncover, and your garments ye do not rend, that ye die not, and on all the company He be wroth; as to your brethren, the whole house of Israel, they bewail the burning which Jehovah hath kindled;
[10:7] and from the opening of the tent of meeting ye do not go out, lest ye die, for the anointing oil of Jehovah `is' upon you;' and they do according to the word of Moses.
[10:8] And Jehovah speaketh unto Aaron, saying,
[10:9] `Wine and strong drink thou dost not drink, thou, and thy sons with thee, in your going in unto the tent of meeting, and ye die not -- a statute age-during to your generations;
[10:10] so as to make a separation between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the pure;
[10:11] and to teach the sons of Israel all the statutes which Jehovah hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.'
[10:12] And Moses speaketh unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar, and unto Ithamar his sons, who are left, `Take ye the present that is left from the fire-offerings of Jehovah, and eat it unleavened near the altar, for it `is' most holy,
[10:13] and ye have eaten it in the holy place, for it `is' thy portion, and the portion of thy sons, from the fire-offerings of Jehovah; for so I have been commanded.
[10:14] `And the breast of the wave-offering, and the leg of the heave-offering, ye do eat in a clean place, thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee; for thy portion and the portion of thy sons they have been given, out of the sacrifices of peace-offerings of the sons of Israel;
[10:15] the leg of the heave-offering, and breast of the wave-offering, besides fire-offerings of the fat, they do bring in to wave a wave-offering before Jehovah, and it hath been to thee, and to thy sons with thee, by a statute age-during, as Jehovah hath commanded.'
[10:16] And the goat of the sin-offering hath Moses diligently sought, and lo, it is burnt, and he is wroth against Eleazar, and against Ithamar, sons of Aaron, who are left, saying,
[10:17] `Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin-offering in the holy place, for it `is' most holy -- and it He hath given to you to take away the iniquity of the company, to make atonement for them before Jehovah?
[10:18] lo, its blood hath not been brought in unto the holy place within; eating ye do eat it in the holy place, as I have commanded.'
[10:19] And Aaron speaketh unto Moses, `Lo, to-day they have brought near their sin-offering and their burnt-offering before Jehovah; and `things' like these meet me, yet I have eaten a sin-offering to-day; is it good in the eyes of Jehovah?'
[10:20] And Moses hearkeneth, and it is good in his eyes.
[11:1] And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying unto them,
[11:2] `Speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, This `is' the beast which ye do eat out of all the beasts which `are' on the earth:
[11:3] any dividing a hoof, and cleaving the cleft of the hoofs, bringing up the cud, among the beasts, it ye do eat.
[11:4] `Only, this ye do not eat -- of those bringing up the cud, and of those dividing the hoof -- the camel, though it is bringing up the cud, yet the hoof not dividing -- it `is' unclean to you;
[11:5] and the rabbit, though it is bringing up the cud, yet the hoof it divideth not -- unclean it `is' to you;
[11:6] and the hare, though it is bringing up the cud, yet the hoof hath not divided -- unclean it `is' to you;
[11:7] and the sow, though it is dividing the hoof, and cleaving the cleft of the hoof, yet the cud it bringeth not up -- unclean it `is' to you.
[11:8] `Of their flesh ye do not eat, and against their carcase ye do not come -- unclean they `are' to you.
[11:9] `This ye do eat of all which `are' in the waters; any one that hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the brooks, them ye do eat;
[11:10] and any one that hath not fins and scales in the seas, and in the brooks, of any teeming creature of the waters, and of any creature which liveth, which `is' in the waters -- an abomination they `are' to you;
[11:11] yea, an abomination they are to you; of their flesh ye do not eat, and their carcase ye abominate.
[11:12] `Any one that hath not fins and scales in the waters -- an abomination it `is' to you.
[11:13] `And these ye do abominate of the fowl; they are not eaten, an abomination they `are': the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray,
[11:14] and the vulture, and the kite after its kind,
[11:15] every raven after its kind,
[11:16] and the owl, and the night-hawk, and the cuckoo, and the hawk after its kind,
[11:17] and the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl,
[11:18] and the swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle,
[11:19] and the stork, the heron after its kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.
[11:20] `Every teeming creature which is flying, which is going on four -- an abomination it `is' to you.
[11:21] `Only -- this ye do eat of any teeming thing which is flying, which is going on four, which hath legs above its feet, to move with them on the earth;
[11:22] these of them ye do eat: the locust after its kind, and the bald locust after its kind, and the beetle after its kind, and the grasshopper after its kind;
[11:23] and every teeming thing which is flying, which hath four feet -- an abomination it `is' to you.
[11:24] `And by these ye are made unclean, any one who is coming against their carcase is unclean till the evening;
[11:25] and anyone who is lifting up `aught' of their carcase doth wash his garments, and hath been unclean till the evening: --
[11:26] even every beast which is dividing the hoof, and is not cloven-footed, and the cud is not bringing up -- unclean they `are' to you; any one who is coming against them is unclean.
[11:27] `And any one going on its paws, among all the beasts which are going on four -- unclean they `are' to you; any one who is coming against their carcase is unclean until the evening;
[11:28] and he who is lifting up their carcase doth wash his garments, and hath been unclean until the evening -- unclean they `are' to you.
[11:29] `And this `is' to you the unclean among the teeming things which are teeming on the earth: the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise after its kind,
[11:30] and the ferret, and the chameleon, and the lizard, and the snail, and the mole;
[11:31] these `are' the unclean to you among all which are teeming; any one who is coming against them in their death is unclean till the evening.
[11:32] `And anything on which any one of them falleth, in their death, is unclean, of any vessel of wood or garment or skin or sack, any vessel in which work is done is brought into water, and hath been unclean till the evening, then it hath been clean;
[11:33] and any earthen vessel, into the midst of which `any' one of them falleth, all that `is' in its midst is unclean, and it ye do break.
[11:34] `Of all the food which is eaten, that on which cometh `such' water, is unclean, and all drink which is drunk in any `such' vessel is unclean;
[11:35] and anything on which `any' of their carcase falleth is unclean (oven or double pots), it is broken down, unclean they `are', yea, unclean they are to you.
[11:36] `Only -- a fountain or pit, a collection of water, is clean, but that which is coming against their carcase is unclean;
[11:37] and when `any' of their carcase falleth on any sown seed which is sown -- it `is' clean;
[11:38] and when water is put on the seed, and `any' of its carcase hath fallen on it -- unclean it `is' to you.
[11:39] `And when any of the beasts which are to you for food dieth, he who is coming against its carcase is unclean till the evening;
[11:40] and he who is eating of its carcase doth wash his garments, and hath been unclean till the evening; and he who is lifting up its carcase doth wash his garments, and hath been unclean till the evening.
[11:41] `And every teeming thing which is teeming on the earth is an abomination, it is not eaten;
[11:42] any thing going on the belly, and any going on four, unto every multiplier of feet, to every teeming thing which is teeming on the earth -- ye do not eat them, for they `are' an abomination;
[11:43] ye do not make yourselves abominable with any teeming thing which is teeming, nor do ye make yourselves unclean with them, so that ye have been unclean thereby.
[11:44] `For I `am' Jehovah your God, and ye have sanctified yourselves, and ye have been holy, for I `am' holy; and ye do not defile your persons with any teeming thing which is creeping on the earth;
[11:45] for I `am' Jehovah who am bringing you up out of the land of Egypt to become your God; and ye have been holy, for I `am' holy.
[11:46] `This `is' a law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every living creature which is moving in the waters, and of every creature which is teeming on the earth,
[11:47] to make separation between the unclean and the pure, and between the beast that is eaten, and the beast that is not eaten.'
[12:1] And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,
[12:2] `Speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, A woman when she giveth seed, and hath born a male, then she hath been unclean seven days, according to the days of separation for her sickness she is unclean;
[12:3] and in the eighth day is the flesh of his foreskin circumcised;
[12:4] and thirty and three days she doth abide in the blood of her cleansing; against any holy thing she doth not come, and unto the sanctuary she doth not go in, till the fulness of the days of her cleansing.
[12:5] `And if a female she bear, then she hath been unclean two weeks, as in her separation; and sixty and six days she doth abide for the blood of her cleansing.
[12:6] `And in the fulness of the days of her cleansing for son or for daughter she doth bring in a lamb, a son of a year, for a burnt-offering, and a young pigeon or a turtle-dove for a sin-offering, unto the opening of the tent of meeting, unto the priest;
[12:7] and he hath brought it near before Jehovah, and hath made atonement for her, and she hath been cleansed from the fountain of her blood; this `is' the law of her who is bearing, in regard to a male or to a female.
[12:8] `And if her hand find not the sufficiency of a sheep, then she hath taken two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, one for a burnt-offering, and one for a sin-offering, and the priest hath made atonement for her, and she hath been cleansed.'
[13:1] And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, and unto Aaron, saying,
[13:2] `When a man hath in the skin of his flesh a rising, or scab, or bright spot, and it hath become in the skin of his flesh a leprous plague, then he hath been brought in unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the priests;
[13:3] and the priest hath seen the plague in the skin of the flesh, and the hair in the plague hath turned white, and the appearance of the plague `is' deeper than the skin of his flesh -- it `is' a plague of leprosy, and the priest hath seen him, and hath pronounced him unclean.
[13:4] `And if the bright spot is white in the skin of his flesh, and its appearance is not deeper than the skin, and its hair hath not turned white, then hath the priest shut up `him who hath' the plague seven days.
[13:5] `And the priest hath seen him on the seventh day, and lo, the plague hath stood in his eyes, the plague hath not spread in the skin, and the priest hath shut him up a second seven days.
[13:6] `And the priest hath seen him on the second seventh day, and lo, the plague is become weak, and the plague hath not spread in the skin -- and the priest hath pronounced him clean, it `is' a scab, and he hath washed his garments, and hath been clean.
[13:7] `And if the scab spread greatly in the skin, after his being seen by the priest for his cleansing, then he hath been seen a second time by the priest;
[13:8] and the priest hath seen, and lo, the scab hath spread in the skin, and the priest hath pronounced him unclean; it `is' leprosy.
[13:9] `When a plague of leprosy is in a man, then he hath been brought in unto the priest,
[13:10] and the priest hath seen, and lo, a white rising in the skin, and it hath turned the hair white, and a quickening of raw flesh `is' in the rising, --
[13:11] an old leprosy it `is' in the skin of his flesh, and the priest hath pronounced him unclean; he doth not shut him up, for he `is' unclean.
[13:12] `And if the leprosy break out greatly in the skin, and the leprosy hath covered all the skin of `him who hath' the plague, from his head even unto his feet, to all that appeareth to the eyes of the priest,
[13:13] then hath the priest seen, and lo, the leprosy hath covered all his flesh, and he hath pronounced `him who hath' the plague clean; it hath all turned white; he `is' clean.
[13:14] `And in the day of raw flesh being seen in him he is unclean;
[13:15] and the priest hath seen the raw flesh, and hath pronounced him unclean; the raw flesh is unclean, it `is' leprosy.
[13:16] Or when the raw flesh turneth back, and hath been turned to white, then he hath come in unto the priest,
[13:17] and the priest hath seen him, and lo, the plague hath been turned to white, and the priest hath pronounced clean `him who hath' the plague; he `is' clean.
[13:18] `And when flesh hath in it, in its skin, an ulcer, and it hath been healed,
[13:19] and there hath been in the place of the ulcer a white rising, or a bright white spot, very red, then it hath been seen by the priest,
[13:20] and the priest hath seen, and lo, its appearance `is' lower than the skin, and its hair hath turned white, and the priest hath pronounced him unclean; it `is' a plague of leprosy -- in an ulcer it hath broken out.
[13:21] `And if the priest see it, and lo, there is no white hair in it, and it is not lower than the skin, and is become weak, then hath the priest shut him up seven days;
[13:22] and if it spread greatly in the skin, then hath the priest pronounced him unclean, it `is' a plague;
[13:23] and if in its place the bright spot stay -- it hath not spread -- it `is' an inflammation of the ulcer; and the priest hath pronounced him clean.
[13:24] `Or when flesh hath in its skin a fiery burning, and the quickening of the burning, the bright white spot, hath been very red or white,
[13:25] and the priest hath seen it, and lo, the hair hath turned white in the bright spot, and its appearance `is' deeper than the skin; leprosy it `is', in the burning it hath broken out, and the priest hath pronounced him unclean; it `is' a plague of leprosy.
[13:26] `And if the priest see it, and lo, there is no white hair on the bright spot, and it is not lower than the skin, and it is become weak, then the priest hath shut him up seven days;
[13:27] and the priest hath seen him on the seventh day, if it spread greatly in the skin, then the priest hath pronounced him unclean; a plague of leprosy it `is'.
[13:28] `And if the bright spot stay in its place, it hath not spread in the skin, and is become weak; a rising of the burning it `is', and the priest hath pronounced him clean; for it `is' inflammation of the burning.
[13:29] `And when a man (or a woman) hath in him a plague in the head or in the beard,
[13:30] then hath the priest seen the plague, and lo, its appearance is deeper than the skin, and in it a thin shining hair, and the priest hath pronounced him unclean; it `is' a scall -- it `is' a leprosy of the head or of the beard.
[13:31] `And when the priest seeth the plague of the scall, and lo, its appearance is not deeper than the skin, and there is no black hair in it, then hath the priest shut up `him who hath' the plague of the scall seven days.
[13:32] `And the priest hath seen the plague on the seventh day, and lo, the scall hath not spread, and a shining hair hath not been in it, and the appearance of the scall is not deeper than the skin,
[13:33] then he hath shaved himself, but the scall he doth not shave; and the priest hath shut up `him who hath' the scall a second seven days.
[13:34] And the priest hath seen the scall on the seventh day, and lo, the scall hath not spread in the skin, and its appearance is not deeper than the skin, and the priest hath pronounced him clean, and he hath washed his garments, and hath been clean.
[13:35] `And if the scall spread greatly in the skin after his cleansing,
[13:36] and the priest hath seen him, and lo, the scall hath spread in the skin, the priest seeketh not for the shining hair, he is unclean;
[13:37] and if in his eyes the scall hath stayed, and black hair hath sprung up in it, the scall hath been healed -- he `is' clean -- and the priest hath pronounced him clean.
[13:38] `And when a man or woman hath in the skin of their flesh bright spots, white bright spots,
[13:39] and the priest hath seen, and lo, in the skin of their flesh white weak bright spots, it `is' a freckled spot broken out in the skin; he `is' clean.
[13:40] `And when a man's head `is' polished, he `is' bald, he `is' clean;
[13:41] and if from the corner of his face his head is polished, he `is' bald of the forehead; he `is' clean.
[13:42] `And when there is in the bald back of the head, or in the bald forehead, a very red white plague, it `is' a leprosy breaking out in the bald back of the head, or in the bald forehead;
[13:43] and the priest hath seen him, and lo, the rising of the very red white plague in the bald back of the head, or in the bald forehead, `is' as the appearance of leprosy, in the skin of the flesh,
[13:44] he `is' a leprous man, he `is' unclean; the priest doth pronounce him utterly unclean; his plague `is' in his head.
[13:45] `As to the leper in whom `is' the plague, his garments are rent, and his head is uncovered, and he covereth over the upper lip, and `Unclean! unclean!' he calleth;
[13:46] all the days that the plague `is' in him he is unclean; he `is' unclean, alone he doth dwell, at the outside of the camp `is' his dwelling.
[13:47] `And when there is in any garment a plague of leprosy, -- in a garment of wool, or in a garment of linen,
[13:48] or in the warp, or in the woof, of linen or of wool, or in a skin, or in any work of skin,
[13:49] and the plague hath been very green or very red in the garment, or in the skin, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in any vessel of skin, it `is' a plague of leprosy, and it hath been shewn the priest.
[13:50] `And the priest hath seen the plague, and hath shut up `that which hath' the plague, seven days;
[13:51] and he hath seen the plague on the seventh day, and the plague hath spread in the garment, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in the skin, of all that is made of skin for work; the plague `is' a fretting leprosy, it `is' unclean.
[13:52] `And he hath burnt the garment, or the warp, or the woof, in wool or in linen, or any vessel of skin in which the plague is; for it `is' a fretting leprosy; with fire it is burnt.
[13:53] `And if the priest see, and lo, the plague hath not spread in the garment, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in any vessel of skin,
[13:54] then hath the priest commanded, and they have washed that in which the plague `is', and he hath shut it up a second seven days.
[13:55] And the priest hath seen `that which hath' the plague after it hath been washed, and lo, the plague hath not changed its aspect, and the plague hath not spread, -- it `is' unclean; with fire thou dost burn it; it `is' a fretting in its back-part or in its front-part.
[13:56] `And if the priest hath seen, and lo, the plague `is' become weak after it hath been washed, then he hath rent it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof;
[13:57] and if it still be seen in the garment, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in any vessel of skin, it `is' a fretting; with fire thou dost burn it -- that in which the plague `is'.
[13:58] `And the garment, or the warp, or the woof, or any vessel of skin which thou dost wash when the plague hath turned aside from them, then it hath been washed a second time, and hath been clean.
[13:59] `This `is' the law of a plague of leprosy `in' a garment of wool or of linen, or of the warp or of the woof, or of any vessel of skin, to pronounce it clean or to pronounce it unclean.'
[14:1] And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,
[14:2] `This is a law of the leper, in the day of his cleansing, that he hath been brought in unto the priest,
[14:3] and the priest hath gone out unto the outside of the camp, and the priest hath seen, and lo, the plague of leprosy hath ceased from the leper,
[14:4] and the priest hath commanded, and he hath taken for him who is to be cleansed, two clean living birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop.
[14:5] `And the priest hath commanded, and he hath slaughtered the one bird upon an earthen vessel, over running water;
[14:6] `as to' the living bird, he taketh it, and the cedar wood, and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and hath dipped them and the living bird in the blood of the slaughtered bird, over the running water,
[14:7] and he hath sprinkled on him who is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and hath pronounced him clean, and hath sent out the living bird on the face of the field.
[14:8] `And he who is to be cleansed hath washed his garments, and hath shaved all his hair, and hath bathed with water, and hath been clean, and afterwards he doth come in unto the camp, and hath dwelt at the outside of his tent seven days.
[14:9] `And it hath been, on the seventh day -- he shaveth all his hair, his head, and his beard, and his eyebrows, even all his hair he doth shave, and he hath washed his garments, and hath bathed his flesh with water, and hath been clean.
[14:10] `And on the eighth day he taketh two lambs, perfect ones, and one ewe-lamb, daughter of a year, a perfect one, and three tenth deals of flour `for' a present, mixed with oil, and one log of oil.
[14:11] `And the priest who is cleansing hath caused the man who is to be cleansed to stand with them before Jehovah, at the opening of the tent of meeting,
[14:12] and the priest hath taken the one he-lamb, and hath brought it near for a guilt-offering, also the log of oil, and hath waved them -- a wave offering before Jehovah.
[14:13] `And he hath slaughtered the lamb in the place where he slaughtereth the sin-offering and the burnt-offering, in the holy place; for like the sin-offering the guilt-offering is to the priest; it `is' most holy.
[14:14] `And the priest hath taken of the blood of the guilt-offering, and the priest hath put on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot;
[14:15] and the priest hath taken of the log of oil, and hath poured on the left palm of the priest,
[14:16] and the priest hath dipped his right finger in the oil which `is' on his left palm, and hath sprinkled of the oil with his finger seven times before Jehovah.
[14:17] `And of the residue of the oil which `is' on his palm, the priest putteth on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot, on the blood of the guilt-offering;
[14:18] and the remnant of the oil which `is' on the palm of the priest, he putteth on the head of him who is to be cleansed, and the priest hath made atonement for him before Jehovah.
[14:19] `And the priest hath made the sin-offering, and hath made atonement for him who is to be cleansed from his uncleanness, and afterwards he doth slaughter the burnt-offering;
[14:20] and the priest hath caused the burnt-offering to ascend, also the present, on the altar, and the priest hath made atonement for him, and he hath been clean.
[14:21] `And if he `is' poor, and his hand is not reaching `these things', then he hath taken one lamb -- a guilt-offering, for a wave-offering, to make atonement for him, and one-tenth deal of flour mixed with oil for a present, and a log of oil,
[14:22] and two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, which his hand reacheth to, and one hath been a sin-offering, and the one a burnt-offering;
[14:23] and he hath brought them in on the eighth day for his cleansing unto the priest, unto the opening of the tent of meeting, before Jehovah.
[14:24] `And the priest hath taken the lamb of the guilt-offering, and the log of oil, and the priest hath waved them -- a wave-offering before Jehovah;
[14:25] and he hath slaughtered the lamb of the guilt-offering, and the priest hath taken of the blood of the guilt-offering, and hath put on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot;
[14:26] and the priest doth pour of the oil on the left palm of the priest;
[14:27] and the priest hath sprinkled with his right finger of the oil which `is' on his left palm, seven times before Jehovah.
[14:28] `And the priest hath put of the oil which `is' on his palm, on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot, on the place of the blood of the guilt-offering;
[14:29] and the remnant of the oil which `is' on the palm of the priest he doth put on the head of him who is to be cleansed, to make atonement for him, before Jehovah.
[14:30] `And he hath made the one of the turtle-doves, or of the young pigeons (from that which his hand reacheth to,
[14:31] `even' that which his hand reacheth to), the one a sin-offering, and the one a burnt offering, besides the present, and the priest hath made atonement for him who is to be cleansed before Jehovah.
[14:32] This `is' a law of him in whom `is' a plague of leprosy, whose hand reacheth not to his cleansing.'
[14:33] And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, and unto Aaron, saying,
[14:34] `When ye come in unto the land of Canaan, which I am giving to you for a possession, and I have put a plague of leprosy in a house `in' the land of your possession;
[14:35] then hath he whose the house `is' come in and declared to the priest, saying, As a plague hath appeared to me in the house;
[14:36] and the priest hath commanded, and they have prepared the house before the priest cometh in to see the plague (that all which `is' in the house be not unclean), and afterwards doth the priest come in to see the house;
[14:37] and he hath seen the plague, and lo, the plague `is' in the walls of the house, hollow strakes, very green or very red, and their appearance `is' lower than the wall,
[14:38] and the priest hath gone out of the house unto the opening of the house, and hath shut up the house seven days.
[14:39] `And the priest hath turned back on the seventh day, and hath seen, and lo, the plague hath spread in the walls of the house,
[14:40] and the priest hath commanded, and they have drawn out the stones in which the plague `is', and have cast them unto the outside of the city, unto an unclean place;
[14:41] and the house he doth cause to be scraped within round about, and they have poured out the clay which they have scraped off, at the outside of the city, at an unclean place;
[14:42] and they have taken other stones, and brought `them' in unto the place of the stones, and other clay he taketh and hath daubed the house.
[14:43] `And if the plague return, and hath broken out in the house, after he hath drawn out the stones, and after the scraping of the house, and after the daubing;
[14:44] then hath the priest come in and seen, and lo, the plague hath spread in the house; it `is' a fretting leprosy in the house; it `is' unclean.
[14:45] `And he hath broken down the house, its stones, and its wood, and all the clay of the house, and he hath brought `them' forth unto the outside of the city, unto an unclean place.
[14:46] `And he who is going in unto the house all the days he hath shut it up, is unclean till the evening;
[14:47] and he who is lying in the house doth wash his garments; and he who is eating in the house doth wash his garments.
[14:48] `And if the priest certainly come in, and hath seen, and lo, the plague hath not spread in the house after the daubing of the house, then hath the priest pronounced the house clean, for the plague hath been healed.
[14:49] `And he hath taken for the cleansing of the house two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop;
[14:50] and he hath slaughtered the one bird upon an earthen vessel, over running water;
[14:51] and he hath taken the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, and hath dipped them in the blood of the slaughtered bird, and in the running water, and hath sprinkled upon the house seven times.
[14:52] `And he hath cleansed the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet;
[14:53] and he hath sent away the living bird unto the outside of the city unto the face of the field, and hath made atonement for the house, and it hath been clean.
[14:54] `This `is' the law for every plague of the leprosy and for scall,
[14:55] and for leprosy of a garment, and of a house,
[14:56] and for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot, --
[14:57] to direct in the day of being unclean, and in the day of being clean; this `is' the law of the leprosy.'
[15:1] And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, and unto Aaron, saying,
[15:2] `Speak unto the sons of Israel, and ye have said unto them, When there is an issue out of the flesh of any man, `for' his issue he `is' unclean;
[15:3] and this is his uncleanness in his issue -- his flesh hath run with his issue, or his flesh hath stopped from his issue; it `is' his uncleanness.
[15:4] `All the bed on which he lieth who hath the issue is unclean, and all the vessel on which he sitteth is unclean;
[15:5] and any one who cometh against his bed doth wash his garments, and hath bathed with water, and been unclean till the evening.
[15:6] `And he who is sitting on the vessel on which he sitteth who hath the issue, doth wash his garments, and hath bathed with water, and been unclean till the evening.
[15:7] `And he who is coming against the flesh of him who hath the issue, doth wash his garments, and hath bathed with water, and hath been unclean till the evening.
[15:8] `And when he who hath the issue spitteth on him who is clean, then he hath washed his garments, and hath bathed with water, and been unclean till the evening.
[15:9] `And all the saddle on which he rideth who hath the issue is unclean;
[15:10] and any one who is coming against anything which is under him is unclean till the evening, and he who is bearing them doth wash his garments, and hath bathed with water, and been unclean till the evening.
[15:11] `And anyone against whom he cometh who hath the issue (and his hands hath not rinsed with water) hath even washed his garments, and bathed with water, and been unclean till the evening.
[15:12] `And the earthen vessel which he who hath the issue cometh against is broken; and every wooden vessel is rinsed with water.
[15:13] `And when he who hath the issue is clean from his issue, then he hath numbered to himself seven days for his cleansing, and hath washed his garments, and hath bathed his flesh with running water, and been clean.
[15:14] `And on the eighth day he taketh to himself two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, and hath come in before Jehovah unto the opening of the tent of meeting, and hath given them unto the priest;
[15:15] and the priest hath made them, one a sin-offering, and the one a burnt-offering; and the priest hath made atonement for him before Jehovah, because of his issue.
[15:16] `And when a man's seed of copulation goeth out from him, then he hath bathed with water all his flesh, and been unclean till the evening.
[15:17] `And any garment, or any skin on which there is seed of copulation, hath also been washed with water, and been unclean till the evening.
[15:18] `And a woman with whom a man lieth with seed of copulation, they also have bathed with water, and been unclean till the evening.
[15:19] `And when a woman hath an issue -- blood is her issue in her flesh -- seven days she is in her separation, and any one who is coming against her is unclean till the evening.
[15:20] `And anything on which she lieth in her separation is unclean, and anything on which she sitteth is unclean;
[15:21] and any one who is coming against her bed doth wash his garments, and hath bathed with water, and been unclean till the evening.
[15:22] `And any one who is coming against any vessel on which she sitteth doth wash his garments, and hath washed with water, and been unclean till the evening.
[15:23] `And if it `is' on the bed, or on the vessel on which she is sitting, in his coming against it, he is unclean till the evening.
[15:24] `And if a man really lie with her, and her separation is on him, then he hath been unclean seven days, and all the bed on which he lieth is unclean.
[15:25] `And when a woman's issue of blood floweth many days within the time of her separation, or when it floweth over her separation -- all the days of the issue of her uncleanness are as the days of her separation; she `is' unclean.
[15:26] `All the bed on which she lieth all the days of her issue is as the bed of her separation to her, and all the vessel on which she sitteth is unclean as the uncleanness of her separation;
[15:27] and any one who is coming against them is unclean, and hath washed his garments, and hath bathed with water, and been unclean till the evening.
[15:28] `And if she hath been clean from her issue, then she hath numbered to herself seven days, and afterwards she is clean;
[15:29] and on the eighth day she taketh to herself two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, and hath brought them in unto the priest, unto the opening of the tent of meeting;
[15:30] and the priest hath made the one a sin-offering, and the one a burnt-offering, and the priest hath made atonement for her before Jehovah, because of the issue of her uncleanness.
[15:31] `And ye have separated the sons of Israel from their uncleanness, and they die not in their uncleanness, in their defiling My tabernacle which `is' in their midst.
[15:32] `This `is' the law of him who hath an issue, and of him whose seed of copulation goeth out from him, for uncleanness thereby,
[15:33] and of her who is sick in her separation, and of him who hath an issue, the issue of a male or of a female, and of a man who lieth with an unclean woman.'
[16:1] And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, after the death of the two sons of Aaron, in their drawing near before Jehovah, and they die;
[16:2] yea, Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Speak unto Aaron thy brother, and he cometh not in at all times unto the sanctuary within the vail, unto the front of the mercy-seat, which `is' upon the ark, and he dieth not, for in a cloud I am seen upon the mercy-seat.
[16:3] `With this doth Aaron come in unto the sanctuary; with a bullock, a son of the herd, for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering;
[16:4] a holy linen coat he putteth on, and linen trousers are on his flesh, and with a linen girdle he girdeth himself, and with a linen mitre he wrappeth himself up; they `are' holy garments; and he hath bathed with water his flesh, and hath put them on.
[16:5] `And from the company of the sons of Israel he taketh two kids of the goats for a sin-offering, and one ram for a burnt-offering;
[16:6] and Aaron hath brought near the bullock of the sin-offering which is his own, and hath made atonement for himself, and for his house;
[16:7] and he hath taken the two goats, and hath caused them to stand before Jehovah, at the opening of the tent of meeting.
[16:8] `And Aaron hath given lots over the two goats, one lot for Jehovah, and one lot for a goat of departure;
[16:9] and Aaron hath brought near the goat on which the lot for Jehovah hath gone up, and hath made it a sin-offering.
[16:10] `And the goat on which the lot for a goat of departure hath gone up is caused to stand living before Jehovah to make atonement by it, to send it away for a goat of departure into the wilderness.
[16:11] `And Aaron hath brought near the bullock of the sin-offering which is his own, and hath made atonement for himself, and for his house, and hath slaughtered the bullock of the sin-offering which `is' his own,
[16:12] and hath taken the fulness of the censer of burning coals of fire from off the altar, from before Jehovah, and the fulness of his hands of thin spice-perfume, and hath brought `it' within the vail;
[16:13] and he hath put the perfume on the fire before Jehovah, and the cloud of the perfume hath covered the mercy-seat which `is' on the testimony, and he dieth not.
[16:14] `And he hath taken of the blood of the bullock, and hath sprinkled with his finger on the front of the mercy-seat eastward; even at the front of the mercy-seat he doth sprinkle seven times of the blood with his finger.
[16:15] `And he hath slaughtered the goat of the sin-offering which `is' the people's, and hath brought in its blood unto the inside of the vail, and hath done with its blood as he hath done with the blood of the bullock, and hath sprinkled it on the mercy-seat, and at the front of the mercy-seat,
[16:16] and he hath made atonement for the sanctuary because of the uncleanness of the sons of Israel, and because of their transgressions in all their sins; and so he doth for the tent of meeting which is tabernacling with them in the midst of their uncleannesses.
[16:17] `And no man is in the tent of meeting in his going in to make atonement in the sanctuary, till his coming out; and he hath made atonement for himself, and for his house, and for all the assembly of Israel.
[16:18] `And he hath gone out unto the altar which `is' before Jehovah, and hath made atonement for it; and he hath taken of the blood of the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and hath put on the horns of the altar round about;
[16:19] and he hath sprinkled on it of the blood with his finger seven times, and hath cleansed it, and hath hallowed it from the uncleannesses of the sons of Israel.
[16:20] `And he hath ceased from making atonement `for' the sanctuary, and the tent of meeting, and the altar, and hath brought near the living goat;
[16:21] and Aaron hath laid his two hands on the head of the living goat, and hath confessed over it all the iniquities of the sons of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, and hath put them on the head of the goat, and hath sent `it' away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness;
[16:22] and the goat hath borne on him all their iniquities unto a land of separation. `And he hath sent the goat away into the wilderness,
[16:23] and Aaron hath come in unto the tent of meeting, and hath stripped off the linen garments which he had put on in his going in unto the sanctuary, and hath placed them there;
[16:24] and he hath bathed his flesh with water in the holy place, and hath put on his garments, and hath come out, and hath made his burnt-offering, and the burnt-offering of the people, and hath made atonement for himself and for the people;
[16:25] and with the fat of the sin-offering he doth make perfume on the altar.
[16:26] `And he who is sending away the goat for a goat of departure doth wash his garments, and hath bathed his flesh with water, and afterwards he cometh in unto the camp.
[16:27] `And the bullock of the sin-offering, and the goat of the sin-offering, whose blood hath been brought in to make atonement in the sanctuary, doth `one' bring out unto the outside of the camp, and they have burnt with fire their skins, and their flesh, and their dung;
[16:28] and he who is burning them doth wash his garments, and hath bathed his flesh with water, and afterwards he cometh in unto the camp.
[16:29] `And it hath been to you for a statute age-during, in the seventh month, in the tenth of the month, ye humble yourselves, and do no work -- the native, and the sojourner who is sojourning in your midst;
[16:30] for on this day he maketh atonement for you, to cleanse you; from all your sins before Jehovah ye are clean;
[16:31] it `is' to you a sabbath of rest, and ye have humbled yourselves -- a statute age-during.
[16:32] `And the priest whom he doth anoint, and whose hand he doth consecrate to act as priest instead of his father, hath made atonement, and hath put on the linen garments, the holy garments;
[16:33] and he hath made atonement `for' the holy sanctuary; and `for' the tent of meeting, even `for' the altar he doth make atonement; yea, for the priests, and for all the people of the assembly he maketh atonement.
[16:34] `And this hath been to you for a statute age-during, to make atonement for the sons of Israel, because of all their sins, once in a year;' and he doth as Jehovah hath commanded Moses.
[17:1] And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,
[17:2] `Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the sons of Israel; and thou hast said unto them, This `is' the thing which Jehovah hath commanded, saying,
[17:3] Any man of the house of Israel who slaughtereth ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or who slaughtereth at the outside of the camp,
[17:4] and unto the opening of the tent of meeting hath not brought it in to bring near an offering to Jehovah before the tabernacle of Jehovah, blood is reckoned to that man -- blood he hath shed -- and that man hath been cut off from the midst of his people;
[17:5] so that the sons of Israel do bring in their sacrifices which they are sacrificing on the face of the field, yea, they have brought them in to Jehovah, unto the opening of the tent of meeting, unto the priest, and they have sacrificed sacrifices of peace-offerings to Jehovah with them.
[17:6] `And the priest hath sprinkled the blood upon the altar of Jehovah, at the opening of the tent of meeting, and hath made perfume with the fat for sweet fragrance to Jehovah;
[17:7] and they sacrifice not any more their sacrifices to goats after which they are going a-whoring; a statute age-during is this to them, to their generations.
[17:8] `And unto them thou sayest: Any man of the house of Israel, or of the sojourners, who sojourneth in your midst, who causeth burnt-offering or sacrifice to ascend,
[17:9] and unto the opening of the tent of meeting doth not bring it in to make it to Jehovah -- that man hath been cut off from his people.
[17:10] `And any man of the house of Israel, or of the sojourners, who is sojourning in your midst, who eateth any blood, I have even set My face against the person who is eating the blood, and have cut him off from the midst of his people;
[17:11] for the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you on the altar, to make atonement for your souls; for it `is' the blood which maketh atonement for the soul.
[17:12] `Therefore I have said to the sons of Israel, No person among you doth eat blood, and the sojourner who is sojourning in your midst doth not eat blood;
[17:13] and any man of the sons of Israel, or of the sojourners, who is sojourning in your midst, who hunteth venison, beast or fowl, which is eaten -- hath even poured out its blood, and hath covered it with dust;
[17:14] for `it is' the life of all flesh, its blood is for its life; and I say to the sons of Israel, Blood of any flesh ye do not eat, for the life of all flesh is its blood; any one eating it is cut off.
[17:15] `And any person who eateth a carcase or torn thing, among natives or among sojourners -- hath both washed his garments, and hath bathed with water, and hath been unclean until the evening -- then he hath been clean;
[17:16] and if he wash not, and his flesh bathe not -- then he hath borne his iniquity.'
[18:1] And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,
[18:2] `Speak unto the sons of Israel, and thou hast said unto them, I `am' Jehovah your God;
[18:3] according to the work of the land of Egypt in which ye have dwelt ye do not, and according to the work of the land of Canaan whither I am bringing you in, ye do not, and in their statutes ye walk not.
[18:4] `My judgments ye do, and My statutes ye keep, to walk in them; I `am' Jehovah your God;
[18:5] and ye have kept My statutes and My judgments which man doth and liveth in them; I `am' Jehovah.
[18:6] `None of you unto any relation of his flesh doth draw near to uncover nakedness; I `am' Jehovah.
[18:7] `The nakedness of thy father and the nakedness of thy mother thou dost not uncover, she `is' thy mother; thou dost not uncover her nakedness.
[18:8] `The nakedness of the wife of thy father thou dost not uncover; it `is' the nakedness of thy father.
[18:9] `The nakedness of thy sister, daughter of thy father, or daughter of thy mother, born at home or born without; thou dost not uncover their nakedness.
[18:10] `The nakedness of thy son's daughter, or of thy daughter's daughter: thou dost not uncover their nakedness; for theirs `is' thy nakedness.
[18:11] `The nakedness of a daughter of thy father's wife, begotten of thy father, she `is' thy sister; thou dost not uncover her nakedness.
[18:12] `The nakedness of a sister of thy father thou dost not uncover; she `is' a relation of thy father.
[18:13] `The nakedness of thy mother's sister thou dost not uncover; for she `is' thy mother's relation.
[18:14] `The nakedness of thy father's brother thou dost not uncover; unto his wife thou dost not draw near; she `is' thine aunt.
[18:15] `The nakedness of thy daughter-in-law thou dost not uncover; she `is' thy son's wife; thou dost not uncover her nakedness.
[18:16] `The nakedness of thy brother's wife thou dost not uncover; it `is' thy brother's nakedness.
[18:17] `The nakedness of a woman and her daughter thou dost not uncover; her son's daughter, and her daughter's daughter thou dost not take to uncover her nakedness; they `are' her relations; it `is' wickedness.
[18:18] `And a woman unto another thou dost not take, to be an adversary, to uncover her nakedness beside her, in her life.
[18:19] `And unto a woman in the separation of her uncleanness thou dost not draw near to uncover her nakedness.
[18:20] `And unto the wife of thy fellow thou dost not give thy seed of copulation, for uncleanness with her.
[18:21] `And of thy seed thou dost not give to pass over to the Molech; nor dost thou pollute the name of thy God; I `am' Jehovah.
[18:22] `And with a male thou dost not lie as one lieth with a woman; abomination it `is'.
[18:23] `And with any beast thou dost not give thy copulation, for uncleanness with it; and a woman doth not stand before a beast to lie down with it; confusion it `is'.
[18:24] `Ye are not defiled with all these, for with all these have the nations been defiled which I am sending away from before you;
[18:25] and the land is defiled, and I charge its iniquity upon it, and the land vomiteth out its inhabitants:
[18:26] and ye -- ye have kept My statutes and My judgments, and do not `any' of all these abominations, the native and the sojourner who is sojourning in your midst,
[18:27] (for all these abominations have the men of the land done who `are' before you, and the land is defiled),
[18:28] and the land doth not vomit you out in your defiling it, as it hath vomited out the nation which `is' before you;
[18:29] for any one who doth `any' of all these abominations -- even the persons who are doing `so', have been cut off from the midst of their people;
[18:30] and ye have kept My charge, so as not to do `any' of the abominable statutes which have been done before you, and ye do not defile yourselves with them; I `am' Jehovah your God.'
[19:1] And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,
[19:2] `Speak unto all the company of the sons of Israel, and thou hast said unto them, Ye are holy, for holy `am' I, Jehovah, your God.
[19:3] `Each his mother and his father ye do fear, and My sabbaths ye do keep; I `am' Jehovah your God.
[19:4] `Ye do not turn unto the idols, and a molten god ye do not make to yourselves; I `am' Jehovah your God.
[19:5] `And when ye sacrifice a sacrifice of peace-offerings to Jehovah, at your pleasure ye do sacrifice it;
[19:6] in the day of your sacrificing it is eaten, and on the morrow, and that which is left unto the third day with fire is burnt,
[19:7] and if it be really eaten on the third day, it `is' an abomination, it is not pleasing,
[19:8] and he who is eating it his iniquity doth bear, for the holy thing of Jehovah he hath polluted, and that person hath been cut off from his people.
[19:9] `And in your reaping the harvest of your land ye do not completely reap the corner of thy field, and the gleaning of thy harvest thou dost not gather,
[19:10] and thy vineyard thou dost not glean, even the omitted part of thy vineyard thou dost not gather, to the poor and to the sojourner thou dost leave them; I `am' Jehovah your God.
[19:11] `Ye do not steal, nor feign, nor lie one against his fellow.
[19:12] `And ye do not swear by My name to falsehood, or thou hast polluted the name of thy God; I `am' Jehovah.
[19:13] `Thou dost not oppress thy neighbour, nor take plunder; the wages of the hireling doth not remain with thee till morning.
[19:14] `Thou dost not revile the deaf; and before the blind thou dost not put a stumbling block; and thou hast been afraid of thy God; I `am' Jehovah.
[19:15] `Ye do not do perversity in judgment; thou dost not lift up the face of the poor, nor honour the face of the great; in righteousness thou dost judge thy fellow.
[19:16] `Thou dost not go slandering among thy people; thou dost not stand against the blood of thy neighbour; I `am' Jehovah.
[19:17] `Thou dost not hate thy brother in thy heart; thou dost certainly reprove thy fellow, and not suffer sin on him.
[19:18] `Thou dost not take vengeance, nor watch the sons of thy people; and thou hast had love to thy neighbour as thyself; I `am' Jehovah.
[19:19] `My statutes ye do keep: thy cattle thou dost not cause to gender `with' diverse kinds; thy field thou dost not sow with diverse kinds, and a garment of diverse kinds, shaatnez, doth not go up upon thee.
[19:20] `And when a man lieth with a woman with seed of copulation, and she a maid-servant, betrothed to a man, and not really ransomed, or freedom hath not been given to her, an investigation there is; they are not put to death, for she `is' not free.
[19:21] `And he hath brought in his guilt-offering to Jehovah, unto the opening of the tent of meeting, a ram `for' a guilt-offering,
[19:22] and the priest hath made atonement for him with the ram of the guilt-offering before Jehovah, for his sin which he hath sinned, and it hath been forgiven him because of his sin which he hath sinned.
[19:23] `And when ye come in unto the land, and have planted all `kinds' of trees `for' food, then ye have reckoned as uncircumcised its fruit, three years it is to you uncircumcised, it is not eaten,
[19:24] and in the fourth year all its fruit is holy -- praises for Jehovah.
[19:25] And in the fifth year ye do eat its fruit -- to add to you its increase; I `am' Jehovah your God.
[19:26] `Ye do not eat with the blood; ye do not enchant, nor observe clouds.
[19:27] `Ye do not round the corner of your head, nor destroy the corner of thy beard.
[19:28] `And a cutting for the soul ye do not put in your flesh; and a writing, a cross-mark, ye do not put on you; I `am' Jehovah.
[19:29] `Thou dost not pollute thy daughter to cause her to go a-whoring, that the land go not a-whoring, and the land hath been full of wickedness.
[19:30] `My sabbaths ye do keep, and My sanctuary ye do reverence; I `am' Jehovah.
[19:31] `Ye do not turn unto those having familiar spirits; and unto wizards ye do not seek, for uncleanness by them; I `am' Jehovah your God.
[19:32] `At the presence of grey hairs thou dost rise up, and thou hast honoured the presence of an old man, and hast been afraid of thy God; I `am' Jehovah.
[19:33] `And when a sojourner sojourneth with thee in your land, thou dost not oppress him;
[19:34] as a native among you is the sojourner to you who is sojourning with you, and thou hast had love to him as to thyself, for sojourners ye have been in the land of Egypt; I `am' Jehovah your God.
[19:35] `Ye do not do perversity in judgment, in mete-yard, in weight, or in liquid measure;
[19:36] righteous balances, righteous weights, a righteous ephah, and a righteous hin ye have; I `am' Jehovah your God, who hath brought you out from the land of Egypt;
[19:37] and ye have observed all my statutes, and all my judgments, and have done them; I `am' Jehovah.'
[20:1] And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,
[20:2] `And unto the sons of Israel thou dost say, Any man of the sons of Israel, and of the sojourners who is sojourning in Israel, who giveth of his seed to the Molech, is certainly put to death; the people of the land do stone him with stones;
[20:3] and I -- I set My face against that man, and have cut him off from the midst of his people, for of his seed he hath given to the Molech, so as to defile My sanctuary, and to pollute My holy name.
[20:4] `And if the people of the land really hide their eyes from that man, in his giving of his seed to the Molech, so as not to put him to death,
[20:5] then I have set My face against that man, and against his family, and have cut him off, and all who are going a-whoring after him, even going a-whoring after the Molech, from the midst of their people.
[20:6] `And the person who turneth unto those having familiar spirits, and unto the wizards, to go a-whoring after them, I have even set My face against that person, and cut him off from the midst of his people.
[20:7] `And ye have sanctified yourselves, and ye have been holy, for I `am' Jehovah your God;
[20:8] and ye have kept My statutes and have done them; I `am' Jehovah, sanctifying you.
[20:9] `For any man who revileth his father and his mother is certainly put to death; his father and his mother he hath reviled: his blood `is' on him.
[20:10] `And a man who committeth adultery with a man's wife -- who committeth adultery with the wife of his neighbour -- the adulterer and the adulteress are surely put to death.
[20:11] `And a man who lieth with his father's wife -- the nakedness of his father he hath uncovered -- both of them are certainly put to death; their blood `is' on them.
[20:12] `And a man who lieth with his daughter-in-law -- both of them are certainly put to death; confusion they have made; their blood `is' on them.
[20:13] `And a man who lieth with a male as one lieth with a woman; abomination both of them have done; they are certainly put to death; their blood `is' on them.
[20:14] `And a man who taketh the woman and her mother -- it `is' wickedness; with fire they burn him and them, and there is no wickedness in your midst.
[20:15] `And a man who giveth his lying with a beast is certainly put to death, and the beast ye do slay.
[20:16] `And a woman who draweth near unto any beast to lie with it -- thou hast even slain the woman and the beast; they are certainly put to death; their blood `is' on them.
[20:17] `And a man who taketh his sister, a daughter of his father or daughter of his mother, and he hath seen her nakedness, and she seeth his nakedness: it is a shame; and they have been cut off before the eyes of the sons of their people; the nakedness of his sister he hath uncovered; his iniquity he beareth.
[20:18] `And a man who lieth with a sick woman, and hath uncovered her nakedness, her fountain he hath made bare, and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood, -- even both of them have been cut off from the midst of their people.
[20:19] `And the nakedness of thy mother's sister, and of thy father's sister, thou dost not uncover; because his relation he hath made bare; their iniquity they bear.
[20:20] `And a man who lieth with his aunt, the nakedness of his uncle he hath uncovered; their sin they bear; childless they die.
[20:21] `And a man who taketh his brother's wife -- it `is' impurity; the nakedness of his brother he hath uncovered; childless they are.
[20:22] `And ye have kept all My statutes, and all My judgments, and have done them, and the land vomiteth you not out whither I am bringing you in to dwell in it;
[20:23] and ye walk not in the statutes of the nation which I am sending away from before you, for all these they have done, and I am wearied with them;
[20:24] and I say to you, Ye -- ye do possess their ground, and I -- I give it to you to possess it, a land flowing with milk and honey; I `am' Jehovah your God, who hath separated you from the peoples.
[20:25] `And ye have made separation between the pure beasts and the unclean, and between the unclean fowl and the pure, and ye do not make yourselves abominable by beast or by fowl, or by anything which creepeth `on' the ground which I have separated to you for unclean;
[20:26] and ye have been holy to Me; for holy `am' I, Jehovah; and I separate you from the peoples to become Mine.
[20:27] `And a man or woman -- when there is in them a familiar spirit, or who `are' wizards -- are certainly put to death; with stones they stone them; their blood `is' on them.'
[21:1] And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Speak unto the priests, sons of Aaron, and thou hast said unto them, For `any' person `a priest' is not defiled among his people,
[21:2] except for his relation who `is' near unto him -- for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his brother.
[21:3] and for his sister, the virgin, who is near unto him, who hath not been to a man; for her he is defiled.
[21:4] `A master `priest' doth not defile himself among his people -- to pollute himself;
[21:5] they do not make baldness on their head, and the corner of their beard they do not shave, and in their flesh they do not make a cutting;
[21:6] they are holy to their God, and they pollute not the name of their God, for the fire-offerings of Jehovah, bread of their God, they are bringing near, and have been holy.
[21:7] `A woman, a harlot, or polluted, they do not take, and a woman cast out from her husband they do not take, for he `is' holy to his God;
[21:8] and thou hast sanctified him, for the bread of thy God he is bringing near; he is holy to thee; for holy `am' I, Jehovah, sanctifying you.
[21:9] `And a daughter of any priest when she polluteth herself by going a-whoring -- her father she is polluting; with fire she is burnt.
[21:10] `And the high priest of his brethren, on whose head is poured the anointing oil, and hath consecrated his hand to put on the garments, his head doth not uncover, nor rend his garments,
[21:11] nor beside any dead person doth he come; for his father and for his mother he doth not defile himself;
[21:12] nor from the sanctuary doth he go out, nor doth he pollute the sanctuary of his God, for the separation of the anointing oil of his God `is' on him; I `am' Jehovah.
[21:13] `And he taketh a wife in her virginity;
[21:14] widow, or cast out, or polluted one -- a harlot -- these he doth not take, but a virgin of his own people he doth take `for' a wife,
[21:15] and he doth not pollute his seed among his people; for I `am' Jehovah, sanctifying him.'
[21:16] And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,
[21:17] `Speak unto Aaron, saying, No man of thy seed to their generations in whom there is blemish doth draw near to bring near the bread of his God,
[21:18] for no man in whom `is' blemish doth draw near -- a man blind, or lame or dwarfed, or enlarged,
[21:19] or a man in whom there is a breach in the foot, or a breach in the hand,
[21:20] or hump-backed, or a dwarf, or with a mixture in his eye, or a scurvy person, or scabbed, or broken-testicled.
[21:21] `No man in whom is blemish (of the seed of Aaron the priest) doth come nigh to bring near the fire-offerings of Jehovah; blemish `is' in him; the bread of his God he doth not come nigh to bring near.
[21:22] `Bread of his God -- of the most holy things, and of the holy things -- he doth eat;
[21:23] only, unto the vail he doth not enter, and unto the altar he doth not draw nigh; for blemish `is' in him; and he doth not pollute My sanctuaries; for I `am' Jehovah, sanctifying them.'
[21:24] And Moses speaketh unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the sons of Israel.
[22:1] And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,
[22:2] `Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and they are separated from the holy things of the sons of Israel, and they pollute not My holy name in what they are hallowing to Me; I `am' Jehovah.
[22:3] `Say unto them, To your generations, any man who draweth near, out of all your seed, unto the holy things which the sons of Israel do sanctify to Jehovah, and his uncleanness on him -- even that person hath been cut off from before Me; I `am' Jehovah.
[22:4] `Any man of the seed of Aaron, and is leprous or hath an issue -- of the holy things he doth not eat till that he is clean; and he who is coming against any uncleanness of a person, or a man whose seed of copulation goeth out from him,
[22:5] or a man who cometh against any teeming thing which is unclean to him, or against a man who is unclean to him, even any of his uncleanness --
[22:6] the person who cometh against it -- hath even been unclean till the evening, and doth not eat of the holy things, but hath bathed his flesh with water,
[22:7] and the sun hath gone in, and he hath been clean, and afterwards he doth eat of the holy things, for it `is' his food;
[22:8] a carcase or torn thing he doth not eat, for uncleanness thereby; I `am' Jehovah.
[22:9] `And they have kept My charge, and bear no sin for it, that they have died for it when they pollute it; I `am' Jehovah sanctifying them.
[22:10] `And no stranger doth eat of the holy thing; a settler of a priest and an hireling doth not eat of the holy thing;
[22:11] and when a priest buyeth a person, the purchase of his money, he doth eat of it, also one born in his house; they do eat of his bread.
[22:12] `And a priest's daughter, when she is a strange man's, -- she, of the heave-offering of the holy things doth not eat;
[22:13] and a priest's daughter, when she is a widow, or cast out, and hath no seed, and hath turned back unto the house of her father, as `in' her youth, of her father's bread she doth eat; but no stranger doth eat of it.
[22:14] `And when a man doth eat of a holy thing through ignorance, then he hath added its fifth part to it, and hath given `it' to the priest, with the holy thing;
[22:15] and they do not pollute the holy things of the sons of Israel -- that which they lift up to Jehovah,
[22:16] nor have caused them to bear the iniquity of the guilt-offering in their eating their holy things; for I `am' Jehovah, sanctifying them.'
[22:17] And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,
[22:18] `Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the sons of Israel, and thou hast said unto them, Any man of the house of Israel, or of the sojourners in Israel, who bringeth near his offering, of all his vows, or of all his willing offerings which they bring near to Jehovah for a burnt-offering;
[22:19] at your pleasure a perfect one, a male of the herd, of the sheep or of the goats;
[22:20] nothing in which `is' blemish do ye bring near, for it is not for a pleasing thing for you.
[22:21] `And when a man bringeth near a sacrifice of peace-offerings to Jehovah, to complete a vow, or for a willing-offering, of the herd or of the flock, it is perfect for a pleasing thing: no blemish is in it;
[22:22] blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed -- ye do not bring these near to Jehovah, and a fire-offering ye do not make of them on the altar to Jehovah.
[22:23] `As to an ox or a sheep enlarged or dwarfed -- a willing-offering ye do make it, but for a vow it is not pleasing.
[22:24] As to a bruised, or beaten, or enlarged, or cut thing -- ye do not bring `it' near to Jehovah; even in your land ye do not do it.
[22:25] And from the hand of a son of a stranger ye do not bring near the bread of your God, of any of these, for their corruption `is' in them; blemish `is' in them; they are not pleasing for you.'
[22:26] And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,
[22:27] `When ox or lamb or goat is born, and it hath been seven days under its dam, then from the eighth day and henceforth, it is pleasing for an offering, a fire-offering to Jehovah;
[22:28] but an ox or sheep -- it and its young one, ye do not slaughter in one day.
[22:29] `And when ye sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving to Jehovah, at your pleasure ye do sacrifice,
[22:30] on that day it is eaten, ye do not leave of it till morning; I `am' Jehovah;
[22:31] and ye have kept my commands, and have done them; I `am' Jehovah;
[22:32] and ye do not pollute My holy name, and I have been hallowed in the midst of the sons of Israel; I `am' Jehovah, sanctifying you,
[22:33] who am bringing you up out of the land of Egypt, to become your God; I `am' Jehovah.'
[23:1] And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,
[23:2] `Speak unto the sons of Israel, and thou hast said unto them, Appointed seasons of Jehovah, which ye proclaim, holy convocations, `are' these: they `are' My appointed seasons:
[23:3] six days is work done, and in the seventh day `is' a sabbath of rest, a holy convocation; ye do no work; it `is' a sabbath to Jehovah in all your dwellings.
[23:4] `These `are' appointed seasons of Jehovah, holy convocations, which ye proclaim in their appointed seasons:
[23:5] in the first month, on the fourteenth of the month, between the evenings, `is' the passover to Jehovah;
[23:6] and on the fifteenth day of this month `is' the feast of unleavened things to Jehovah; seven days unleavened things ye do eat;
[23:7] on the first day ye have a holy convocation, ye do no servile work;
[23:8] and ye have brought near a fire-offering to Jehovah seven days; in the seventh day `is' a holy convocation; ye do no servile work.'
[23:9] And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,
[23:10] `Speak unto the sons of Israel, and thou hast said unto them, When ye come in unto the land which I am giving to you, and have reaped its harvest, and have brought in the sheaf, the beginning of your harvest unto the priest,
[23:11] then he hath waved the sheaf before Jehovah for your acceptance; on the morrow of the sabbath doth the priest wave it.
[23:12] `And ye have prepared in the day of your waving the sheaf a lamb, a perfect one, a son of a year, for a burnt-offering to Jehovah,
[23:13] and its present two tenth deals of flour mixed with oil, a fire-offering to Jehovah, a sweet fragrance, and its drink-offering, wine, a fourth of the hin.
[23:14] `And bread and roasted corn and full ears ye do not eat until this self-same day, until your bringing in the offering of your God -- a statute age-during to your generations, in all your dwellings.
[23:15] `And ye have numbered to you from the morrow of the sabbath, from the day of your bringing in the sheaf of the wave-offering: they are seven perfect sabbaths;
[23:16] unto the morrow of the seventh sabbath ye do number fifty days, and ye have brought near a new present to Jehovah;
[23:17] out of your dwellings ye bring in bread of a wave-offering, two `loaves', of two tenth deals of flour they are, `with' yeast they are baken, first-`fruits' to Jehovah.
[23:18] `And ye have brought near, besides the bread, seven lambs, perfect ones, sons of a year, and one bullock, a son of the herd, and two rams; they are a burnt-offering to Jehovah, with their present and their libations, a fire-offering of sweet fragrance to Jehovah.
[23:19] `And ye have prepared one kid of the goats for a sin-offering, and two lambs, sons of a year, for a sacrifice of peace-offerings,
[23:20] and the priest hath waved them, besides the bread of the first-`fruits' -- a wave-offering before Jehovah, besides the two lambs; they are holy to Jehovah for the priest;
[23:21] and ye have proclaimed on this self-same day: a holy convocation is to you, ye do no servile work -- a statute age-during in all your dwellings, to your generations.
[23:22] `And in your reaping the harvest of your land thou dost not complete the corner of thy field in thy reaping, and the gleaning of thy harvest thou dost not gather, to the poor and to the sojourner thou dost leave them; I Jehovah `am' your God.'
[23:23] And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,
[23:24] `Speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, on the first of the month, ye have a sabbath, a memorial of shouting, a holy convocation;
[23:25] ye do no servile work, and ye have brought near a fire-offering to Jehovah.'
[23:26] And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,
[23:27] `Only -- on the tenth of this seventh month is a day of atonements; ye have a holy convocation, and ye have humbled yourselves, and have brought near a fire-offering to Jehovah;
[23:28] and ye do no work in this self-same day, for it is a day of atonements, to make atonement for you, before Jehovah your God.
[23:29] `For any person who is not humbled in this self-same day hath even been cut off from his people;
[23:30] and any person who doth any work in this self-same day I have even destroyed that person from the midst of his people;
[23:31] ye do no work -- a statute age-during to your generations in all your dwellings.
[23:32] It `is' a sabbath of rest to you, and ye have humbled yourselves in the ninth of the month at even; from evening till evening ye do keep your sabbath.'
[23:33] And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,
[23:34] `Speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, In the fifteenth day of this seventh month `is' a feast of booths seven days to Jehovah;
[23:35] on the first day `is' a holy convocation, ye do no servile work,
[23:36] seven days ye bring near a fire-offering to Jehovah, on the eighth day ye have a holy convocation, and ye have brought near a fire-offering to Jehovah; it `is' a restraint, ye do no servile work.
[23:37] `These `are' appointed seasons of Jehovah, which ye proclaim holy convocations, to bring near a fire-offering to Jehovah, a burnt-offering, and a present, a sacrifice, and libations, a thing of a day in its day,
[23:38] apart from the sabbaths of Jehovah, and apart from your gifts, and apart from all your vows, and apart from all your willing-offerings, which ye give to Jehovah.
[23:39] `Only -- in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, in your gathering the increase of the land, ye do keep the feast of Jehovah seven days; on the first day `is' a sabbath, and on the eighth day a sabbath;
[23:40] and ye have taken to yourselves on the first day the fruit of beautiful trees, branches of palms, and boughs of thick trees, and willows of a brook, and have rejoiced before Jehovah your God seven days.
[23:41] `And ye have kept it a feast to Jehovah, seven days in a year -- a statute age-during to your generations; in the seventh month ye keep it a feast.
[23:42] `In booths ye dwell seven days; all who are natives in Israel dwell in booths,
[23:43] so that your generations do know that in booths I caused the sons of Israel to dwell; in my bringing them out of the land of Egypt; I, Jehovah, `am' your God.'
[23:44] And Moses speaketh `concerning' the appointed seasons of Jehovah unto the sons of Israel.
[24:1] And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,
[24:2] `Command the sons of Israel, and they bring unto thee pure olive oil, beaten, for the lamp, to cause a light to go up continually;
[24:3] at the outside of the vail of the testimony in the tent of meeting doth Aaron arrange it from evening till morning before Jehovah continually -- a statute age-during to your generations;
[24:4] by the pure candlestick he doth arrange the lights before Jehovah continually.
[24:5] `And thou hast taken flour, and hast baked twelve cakes with it, two tenth deals are in the one cake,
[24:6] and thou hast set them two ranks (six in the rank) on the pure table before Jehovah,
[24:7] and thou hast put on the rank pure frankincense, and it hath been to the bread for a memorial, a fire-offering to Jehovah.
[24:8] `On each sabbath-day he arrangeth it before Jehovah continually, from the sons of Israel -- a covenant age-during;
[24:9] and it hath been to Aaron, and to his sons, and they have eaten it in the holy place, for it `is' most holy to him, from the fire-offerings of Jehovah -- a statute age-during.'
[24:10] And a son of an Israelitish woman goeth out (and he `is' son of an Egyptian man), in the midst of the sons of Israel, and strive in the camp do the son of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel,
[24:11] and the son of the Israelitish woman execrateth the Name, and revileth; and they bring him in unto Moses; and his mother's name `is' Shelomith daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan;
[24:12] and he causeth him to rest in charge -- to explain to them by the mouth of Jehovah.
[24:13] And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,
[24:14] `Bring out the reviler unto the outside of the camp; and all those hearing have laid their hands on his head, and all the company have stoned him.
[24:15] `And unto the sons of Israel thou dost speak, saying, When any man revileth his God -- then he hath borne his sin;
[24:16] and he who is execrating the name of Jehovah is certainly put to death; all the company do certainly cast stones at him; as a sojourner so a native, in his execrating the Name, is put to death.
[24:17] `And when a man smiteth any soul of man, he is certainly put to death.
[24:18] `And he who smiteth a beast repayeth it, body for body.
[24:19] `And when a man putteth a blemish in his fellow, as he hath done so it is done to him;
[24:20] breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; as he putteth a blemish in a man so it is done in him.
[24:21] `And he who smiteth a beast repayeth it, and he who smiteth `the life of' man is put to death;
[24:22] one judgment is to you; as a sojourner so is a native; for I `am' Jehovah your God.'
[24:23] And Moses speaketh unto the sons of Israel, and they bring out the reviler unto the outside of the camp, and stone him with stones; and the sons of Israel have done as Jehovah hath commanded Moses.
[25:1] And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, in mount Sinai, saying,
[25:2] `Speak unto the sons of Israel, and thou hast said unto them, When ye come in unto the land which I am giving to you, then hath the land kept a sabbath to Jehovah.
[25:3] `Six years thou dost sow thy field, and six years thou dost prune thy vineyard, and hast gathered its increase,
[25:4] and in the seventh year a sabbath of rest is to the land, a sabbath to Jehovah; thy field thou dost not sow, and thy vineyard thou dost not prune;
[25:5] the spontaneous growth of thy harvest thou dost not reap, and the grapes of thy separated thing thou dost not gather, a year of rest it is to the land.
[25:6] `And the sabbath of the land hath been to you for food, to thee, and to thy man-servant, and to thy handmaid, and to thy hireling, and to thy settler, who are sojourning with thee;
[25:7] and to thy cattle, and to the beast which `is' in thy land, is all thine increase for food.
[25:8] `And thou hast numbered to thee seven sabbaths of years, seven years seven times, and the days of the seven sabbaths of years have been to thee nine and forty years,
[25:9] and thou hast caused a trumpet of shouting to pass over in the seventh month, in the tenth of the month; in the day of the atonements ye do cause a trumpet to pass over through all your land;
[25:10] and ye have hallowed the year, the fiftieth year; and ye have proclaimed liberty in the land to all its inhabitants; a jubilee it is to you; and ye have turned back each unto his possession; yea, each unto his family ye do turn back.
[25:11] `A jubilee it `is', the fiftieth year, a year it is to you; ye sow not, nor reap its spontaneous growth, nor gather its separated things;
[25:12] for a jubilee it `is', holy it is to you; out of the field ye eat its increase;
[25:13] in the year of this jubilee ye turn back each unto his possession.
[25:14] `And when thou sellest anything to thy fellow, or buyest from the hand of thy fellow, ye do not oppress one another;
[25:15] by the number of years after the jubilee thou dost buy from thy fellow; by the number of the years of increase he doth sell to thee;
[25:16] according to the multitude of the years thou dost multiply its price, and according to the fewness of the years thou dost diminish its price; for a number of increases he is selling to thee;
[25:17] and ye do not oppress one another, and thou hast been afraid of thy God; for I `am' Jehovah your God.
[25:18] `And ye have done My statutes, and My judgments ye keep, and have done them, and ye have dwelt on the land confidently,
[25:19] and the land hath given its fruit, and ye have eaten to satiety, and have dwelt confidently on it.
[25:20] `And when ye say, What do we eat in the seventh year, lo, we do not sow, nor gather our increase?
[25:21] then I have commanded My blessing on you in the sixth year, and it hath made the increase for three years;
[25:22] and ye have sown the eighth year, and have eaten of the old increase; until the ninth year, until the coming in of its increase, ye do eat the old.
[25:23] `And the land is not sold -- to extinction, for the land `is' Mine, for sojourners and settlers `are' ye with Me;
[25:24] and in all the land of your possession a redemption ye do give to the land.
[25:25] `When thy brother becometh poor, and hath sold his possession, then hath his redeemer who is near unto him come, and he hath redeemed the sold thing of his brother;
[25:26] and when a man hath no redeemer, and his own hand hath attained, and he hath found as sufficient `for' its redemption,
[25:27] then he hath reckoned the years of its sale, and hath given back that which is over to the man to whom he sold `it', and he hath returned to his possession.
[25:28] `And if his hand hath not found sufficiency to give back to him, then hath his sold thing been in the hand of him who buyeth it till the year of jubilee; and it hath gone out in the jubilee, and he hath returned to his possession.
[25:29] `And when a man selleth a dwelling-house `in' a walled city, then hath his right of redemption been until the completion of a year from its selling; days -- is his right of redemption;
[25:30] and if it is not redeemed until the fulness to him of a perfect year, then hath the house which `is' in a walled city been established to extinction to the buyer of it, to his generations; it goeth not out in the jubilee;
[25:31] and a house of the villages which have no wall round about, on the field of the country is reckoned; redemption is to it, and in the jubilee it goeth out.
[25:32] `As to cities of the Levites -- houses of the cities of their possession -- redemption age-during is to the Levites;
[25:33] as to him who redeemeth from the Levites, both the sale of a house and the city of his possession have gone out in the jubilee, for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession in the midst of the sons of Israel.
[25:34] And a field, a suburb of their cities, is not sold; for a possession age-during it `is' to them.
[25:35] `And when thy brother is become poor, and his hand hath failed with thee, then thou hast kept hold on him, sojourner and settler, and he hath lived with thee;
[25:36] thou takest no usury from him, or increase; and thou hast been afraid of thy God; and thy brother hath lived with thee;
[25:37] thy money thou givest not to him in usury, and for increase thou givest not thy food;
[25:38] I `am' Jehovah your God, who hath brought you out of the land of Egypt, to give to you the land of Canaan, to become your God.
[25:39] `And when thy brother becometh poor with thee, and he hath been sold to thee, thou dost not lay on him servile service;
[25:40] as an hireling, as a settler, he is with thee, till the year of the jubilee he doth serve with thee, --
[25:41] then he hath gone out from thee, he and his sons with him, and hath turned back unto his family; even unto the possession of his fathers he doth turn back.
[25:42] `For they `are' My servants, whom I have brought out from the land of Egypt: they are not sold `with' the sale of a servant;
[25:43] thou rulest not over him with rigour, and thou hast been afraid of thy God.
[25:44] `And thy man-servant and thy handmaid whom thou hast `are' of the nations who `are' round about you; of them ye buy man-servant and handmaid,
[25:45] and also of the sons of the settlers who are sojourning with you, of them ye buy, and of their families who `are' with you, which they have begotten in your land, and they have been to you for a possession;
[25:46] and ye have taken them for inheritance to your sons after you, to occupy `for' a possession; to the age ye lay service upon them, but upon your brethren, the sons of Israel, one with another, thou dost not rule over him with rigour.
[25:47] `And when the hand of a sojourner or settler with thee attaineth `riches', and thy brother with him hath become poor, and he hath been sold to a sojourner, a settler with thee, or to the root of the family of a sojourner,
[25:48] after he hath been sold, there is a right of redemption to him; one of his brethren doth redeem him,
[25:49] or his uncle, or a son of his uncle, doth redeem him, or any of the relations of his flesh, of his family, doth redeem him, or -- his own hand hath attained -- then he hath been redeemed.
[25:50] `And he hath reckoned with his buyer from the year of his being sold to him till the year of jubilee, and the money of his sale hath been by the number of years; as the days of an hireling it is with him.
[25:51] `If yet many years, according to them he giveth back his redemption `money', from the money of his purchase.
[25:52] `And if few are left of the years till the year of jubilee, then he hath reckoned with him, according to his years he doth give back his redemption `money';
[25:53] as an hireling, year by year, he is with him, and he doth not rule him with rigour before thine eyes.
[25:54] `And if he is not redeemed in these `years', then he hath gone out in the year of jubilee, he and his sons with him.
[25:55] For to Me `are' the sons of Israel servants; My servants they `are', whom I have brought out of the land of Egypt; I, Jehovah, `am' your God.
[26:1] `Ye do not make to yourselves idols; and graven image or standing image ye do not set up to yourselves; and a stone of imagery ye do not put in your land, to bow yourselves to it; for I `am' Jehovah your God.
[26:2] `My sabbaths ye do keep, and My sanctuary ye do reverence; I `am' Jehovah.
[26:3] `If in My statutes ye walk, and My commands ye keep, and have done them,
[26:4] then I have given your rains in their season, and the land hath given her produce, and the tree of the field doth give its fruit;
[26:5] and reached to you hath the threshing, the gathering, and the gathering doth reach the sowing-`time'; and ye have eaten your bread to satiety, and have dwelt confidently in your land.
[26:6] `And I have given peace in the land, and ye have lain down, and there is none causing trembling; and I have caused evil beasts to cease out of the land, and the sword doth not pass over into your land.
[26:7] `And ye have pursued your enemies, and they have fallen before you by the sword;
[26:8] and five of you have pursued a hundred, and a hundred of you do pursue a myriad; and your enemies have fallen before you by the sword.
[26:9] `And I have turned unto you, and have made you fruitful, and have multiplied you, and have established My covenant with you;
[26:10] and ye have eaten old `store', and the old because of the new ye bring out.
[26:11] `And I have given My tabernacle in your midst, and My soul doth not loathe you;
[26:12] and I have walked habitually in your midst, and have become your God, and ye -- ye are become My people;
[26:13] I `am' Jehovah your God, who have brought you out of the land of the Egyptians, from being their servants; and I break the bars of your yoke, and cause you to go erect.
[26:14] `And if ye do not hearken to Me, and do not all these commands;
[26:15] and if at My statutes ye kick, and if My judgments your soul loathe, so as not to do all My commands -- to your breaking My covenant --
[26:16] I also do this to you, and I have appointed over you trouble, the consumption, and the burning fever, consuming eyes, and causing pain of soul; and your seed in vain ye have sowed, and your enemies have eaten it;
[26:17] and I have set My face against you, and ye have been smitten before your enemies; and those hating you have ruled over you, and ye have fled, and there is none pursuing you.
[26:18] `And if unto these ye hearken not to Me, -- then I have added to chastise you seven times for your sins;
[26:19] and I have broken the pride of your strength, and have made your heavens as iron, and your earth as brass;
[26:20] and consumed hath been your strength in vain, and your land doth not give her produce, and the tree of the land doth not give its fruit.
[26:21] `And if ye walk with Me `in' opposition, and are not willing to hearken to Me, then I have added to you a plague seven times, according to your sins,
[26:22] and sent against you the beast of the field, and it hath bereaved you; and I have cut off your cattle, and have made you few, and your ways have been desolate.
[26:23] `And if by these ye are not instructed by Me, and have walked with Me `in' opposition,
[26:24] then I have walked -- I also -- with you in opposition, and have smitten you, even I, seven times for your sins;
[26:25] and I have brought in on you a sword, executing the vengeance of a covenant; and ye have been gathered unto your cities, and I have sent pestilence into your midst, and ye have been given into the hand of an enemy.
[26:26] `In My breaking to you the staff of bread, then ten women have baked your bread in one oven, and have given back your bread by weight; and ye have eaten, and are not satisfied.
[26:27] `And if for this ye hearken not to Me, and have walked with Me in opposition,
[26:28] then I have walked with you in the fury of opposition, and have chastised you, even I, seven times for your sins.
[26:29] `And ye have eaten the flesh of your sons; even flesh of your daughters ye do eat.
[26:30] And I have destroyed your high places, and cut down your images, and have put your carcases on the carcases of your idols, and My soul hath loathed you;
[26:31] and I have made your cities a waste, and have made desolate your sanctuaries, and I smell not at your sweet fragrances;
[26:32] and I have made desolate the land, and your enemies, who are dwelling in it, have been astonished at it.
[26:33] And you I scatter among nations, and have drawn out after you a sword, and your land hath been a desolation, and your cities are a waste.
[26:34] `Then doth the land enjoy its sabbaths -- all the days of the desolation, and ye in the land of your enemies -- then doth the land rest, and hath enjoyed its sabbaths;
[26:35] all the days of the desolation it resteth that which it hath not rested in your sabbaths in your dwelling on it.
[26:36] `And those who are left of you -- I have also brought a faintness into their heart in the lands of their enemies, and the sound of a leaf driven away hath pursued them, and they have fled -- flight from a sword -- and they have fallen, and there is none pursuing.
[26:37] And they have stumbled one on another, as from the face of a sword, and there is none pursuing, and ye have no standing before your enemies,
[26:38] and ye have perished among the nations, and the land of your enemies hath consumed you.
[26:39] `And those who are left of you -- they consume away in their iniquity, in the lands of your enemies; and also in the iniquities of their fathers, with them they consume away.
[26:40] `And -- they have confessed their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, in their trespass which they have trespassed against Me, and also, that they have walked with Me, in opposition,
[26:41] also I walk to them in opposition, and have brought them into the land of their enemies -- or then their uncircumcised heart is humbled, and then they accept the punishment of their iniquity, --
[26:42] then I have remembered My covenant `with' Jacob, and also My covenant `with' Isaac, and also My covenant `with' Abraham I remember, and the land I remember.
[26:43] `And -- the land is left of them, and doth enjoy its sabbaths, in the desolation without them, and they accept the punishment of their iniquity, because, even because, against My judgments they have kicked, and My statutes hath their soul loathed,
[26:44] and also even this, in their being in the land of their enemies, I have not rejected them, nor have I loathed them, to consume them, to break My covenant with them; for I `am' Jehovah their God; --
[26:45] then I have remembered for them the covenant of the ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt before the eyes of the nations to become their God; I `am' Jehovah.'
[26:46] These `are' the statutes, and the judgments, and the laws, which Jehovah hath given between Him and the sons of Israel, in mount Sinai, by the hand of Moses.
[27:1] And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,
[27:2] `Speak unto the sons of Israel, and thou hast said unto them, When a man maketh a wonderful vow, by thy valuation the persons `are' Jehovah's.
[27:3] When thy valuation hath been of the male from a son of twenty years even unto a son of sixty years, then hath been thy valuation fifty shekels of silver by the shekel of the sanctuary.
[27:4] And if it `is' a female -- then hath thy valuation been thirty shekels;
[27:5] and if from a son of five years even unto a son of twenty years -- then hath thy valuation been of the male twenty shekels, and for the female, ten shekels;
[27:6] and if from a son of a month even unto a son of five years -- then hath thy valuation been of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy valuation `is' three shekels of silver;
[27:7] and if from a son of sixty years and above -- if a male, then hath thy valuation been fifteen shekels, and for a female, ten shekels.
[27:8] `And if he is poorer than thy valuation, then he hath presented himself before the priest, and the priest hath valued him; according to that which the hand of him who is vowing doth reach doth the priest value him.
[27:9] `And if `it is' a beast of which they bring near an offering to Jehovah, all that `one' giveth of it to Jehovah is holy;
[27:10] he doth not change it nor exchange it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good; and if he really change beast for beast, -- then it hath been -- it and its exchange is holy.
[27:11] `And if `it is' any unclean beast of which they do not bring near an offering to Jehovah, then he hath presented the beast before the priest,
[27:12] and the priest hath valued it; whether good or bad, according to thy valuation, O priest, so it is;
[27:13] and if he really redeem it, then he hath added its fifth to thy valuation.
[27:14] `And when a man sanctifieth his house, a holy thing to Jehovah, then hath the priest valued it, whether good or bad; as the priest doth value it so it standeth;
[27:15] and if he who is sanctifying doth redeem his house, then he hath added a fifth of the money of thy valuation to it, and it hath become his.
[27:16] `And if of the field of his possession a man sanctify to Jehovah, then hath thy valuation been according to its seed; a homer of barley-seed at fifty shekels of silver;
[27:17] if from the year of the jubilee he sanctify his field, according to thy valuation it standeth;
[27:18] and if after the jubilee he sanctify his field, then hath the priest reckoned to him the money according to the years which are left, unto the year of the jubilee, and it hath been abated from thy valuation.
[27:19] `And if he really redeem the field -- he who is sanctifying it -- then he hath added a fifth of the money of thy valuation to it, and it hath been established to him;
[27:20] and if he do not redeem the field, or if he hath sold the field to another man, it is not redeemed any more;
[27:21] and the field hath been, in its going out in the jubilee, holy to Jehovah as a field which is devoted; to the priest is its possession.
[27:22] `And if the field of his purchase (which `is' not of the fields of his possession) `one' sanctify to Jehovah --
[27:23] then hath the priest reckoned to him the amount of thy valuation unto the year of jubilee, and he hath given thy valuation in that day -- a holy thing to Jehovah;
[27:24] in the year of the jubilee the field returneth to him from whom he bought it, to him whose `is' the possession of the land.
[27:25] And all thy valuation is by the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs is the shekel.
[27:26] `Only, a firstling which is Jehovah's firstling among beasts -- no man doth sanctify it, whether ox or sheep; it `is' Jehovah's.
[27:27] And if among the unclean beasts, then he hath ransomed `it' at thy valuation, and he hath added its fifth to it; and if it is not redeemed, then it hath been sold at thy valuation.
[27:28] `Only, no devoted thing which a man devoteth to Jehovah, of all that he hath, of man, and beast, and of the field of his possession, is sold or redeemed; every devoted thing is most holy to Jehovah.
[27:29] `No devoted thing, which is devoted of man, is ransomed, it is surely put to death.
[27:30] And all tithe of the land, of the seed of the land, of the fruit of the tree, is Jehovah's -- holy to Jehovah.
[27:31] `And if a man really redeem `any' of his tithe, its fifth he addeth to it.
[27:32] `And all the tithe of the herd and of the flock -- all that passeth by under the rod -- the tenth is holy to Jehovah;
[27:33] he enquireth not between good and bad, nor doth he change it; and if he really change it -- then it hath been -- it and its exchange is holy; it is not redeemed.'
[27:34] These `are' the commands which Jehovah hath commanded Moses for the sons of Israel, in mount Sinai.
