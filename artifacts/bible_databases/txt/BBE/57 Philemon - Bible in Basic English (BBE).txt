Philemon - Bible in Basic English (BBE)
[1:1] Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our dear helper in the faith,
[1:2] And to Apphia, our sister, and to Archippus, our brother in God's army, and to the church in your house:
[1:3] Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:4] I give praise to God at all times and make prayer for you,
[1:5] Hearing of the love and the faith which you have to the Lord Jesus and to all the saints;
[1:6] That the faith which you have in common with them may be working with power, in the knowledge of every good thing in you, for Christ.
[1:7] For I had great joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been made strong again through you, brother.
[1:8] And so, though I might, in the name of Christ, give you orders to do what is right,
[1:9] Still, because of love, in place of an order, I make a request to you, I, Paul, an old man and now a prisoner of Christ Jesus:
[1:10] My request is for my child Onesimus, the child of my chains,
[1:11] Who in the past was of no profit to you, but now is of profit to you and to me:
[1:12] Whom I have sent back to you, him who is my very heart:
[1:13] Though my desire was to keep him with me, to be my servant in the chains of the good news, in your place:
[1:14] But without your approval I would do nothing; so that your good works might not be forced, but done freely from your heart.
[1:15] For it is possible that for this reason he was parted from you for a time, so that you might have him for ever;
[1:16] No longer as a servant, but more than a servant, a brother, very dear to me specially, but much more to you, in the flesh as well as in the Lord.
[1:17] If then you take me to be your friend and brother, take him in as myself.
[1:18] If he has done you any wrong or is in debt to you for anything, put it to my account.
[1:19] I, Paul, writing this myself, say, I will make payment to you: and I do not say to you that you are in debt to me even for your life.
[1:20] So brother, let me have joy of you in the Lord: give new life to my heart in Christ.
[1:21] Being certain that you will do my desire, I am writing to you, in the knowledge that you will do even more than I say.
[1:22] And make a room ready for me; for I am hoping that through your prayers I will be given to you.
[1:23] Epaphras, my brother-prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you his love;
[1:24] And so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my brother-workers.
[1:25] The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. So be it.
