# Philemon - Young's Literal Translation (YLT)

**[1:1]** Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timotheus the brother, to Philemon our beloved and fellow-worker,

**[1:2]** and Apphia the beloved, and Archippus our fellow-soldier, and the assembly in thy house:

**[1:3]** Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ!

**[1:4]** I give thanks to my God, always making mention of thee in my prayers,

**[1:5]** hearing of thy love and faith that thou hast unto the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints,

**[1:6]** that the fellowship of thy faith may become working in the full knowledge of every good thing that `is' in you toward Christ Jesus;

**[1:7]** for we have much joy and comfort in thy love, because the bowels of the saints have been refreshed through thee, brother.

**[1:8]** Wherefore, having in Christ much boldness to command thee that which is fit --

**[1:9]** because of the love I rather entreat, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ;

**[1:10]** I entreat thee concerning my child -- whom I did beget in my bonds -- Onesimus,

**[1:11]** who once was to thee unprofitable, and now is profitable to me and to thee,

**[1:12]** whom I did send again, and thou him (that is, my own bowels) receive,

**[1:13]** whom I did wish to retain to myself, that in thy behalf he might minister to me in the bonds of the good news,

**[1:14]** and apart from thy mind I willed to do nothing, that as of necessity thy good deed may not be, but of willingness,

**[1:15]** for perhaps because of this he did depart for an hour, that age-duringly thou mayest have him,

**[1:16]** no more as a servant, but above a servant -- a brother beloved, especially to me, and how much more to thee, both in the flesh and in the Lord!

**[1:17]** If, then, with me thou hast fellowship, receive him as me,

**[1:18]** and if he did hurt to thee, or doth owe anything, this to me be reckoning;

**[1:19]** I, Paul did write with my hand, I -- I will repay; that I may not say that also thyself, besides, to me thou dost owe.

**[1:20]** Yes, brother, may I have profit of thee in the Lord; refresh my bowels in the Lord;

**[1:21]** having been confident in thy obedience I did write to thee, having known that also above what I may say thou wilt do;

**[1:22]** and at the same time also prepare for me a lodging, for I hope that through your prayers I shall be granted to you.

**[1:23]** Salute thee doth Epaphras, (my fellow-captive in Christ Jesus,)

**[1:24]** Markus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lukas, my fellow-workmen!

**[1:25]** The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ `is' with your spirit! Amen.
