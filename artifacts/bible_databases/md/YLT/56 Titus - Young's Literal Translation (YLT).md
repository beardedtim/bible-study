# Titus - Young's Literal Translation (YLT)

**[1:1]** Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of the choice ones of God, and an acknowledging of truth that `is' according to piety,

**[1:2]** upon hope of life age-during, which God, who doth not lie, did promise before times of ages,

**[1:3]** (and He manifested in proper times His word,) in preaching, which I was entrusted with, according to a charge of God our Saviour,

**[1:4]** to Titus -- true child according to a common faith: Grace, kindness, peace, from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour!

**[1:5]** For this cause left I thee in Crete, that the things lacking thou mayest arrange, and mayest set down in every city elders, as I did appoint to thee;

**[1:6]** if any one is blameless, of one wife a husband, having children stedfast, not under accusation of riotous living or insubordinate --

**[1:7]** for it behoveth the overseer to be blameless, as God's steward, not self-pleased, nor irascible, not given to wine, not a striker, not given to filthy lucre;

**[1:8]** but a lover of strangers, a lover of good men, sober-minded, righteous, kind, self-controlled,

**[1:9]** holding -- according to the teaching -- to the stedfast word, that he may be able also to exhort in the sound teaching, and the gainsayers to convict;

**[1:10]** for there are many both insubordinate, vain-talkers, and mind-deceivers -- especially they of the circumcision --

**[1:11]** whose mouth it behoveth to stop, who whole households do overturn, teaching what things it behoveth not, for filthy lucre's sake.

**[1:12]** A certain one of them, a prophet of their own, said -- `Cretans! always liars, evil beasts, lazy bellies!'

**[1:13]** this testimony is true; for which cause convict them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,

**[1:14]** not giving heed to Jewish fables and commands of men, turning themselves away from the truth;

**[1:15]** all things, indeed, `are' pure to the pure, and to the defiled and unstedfast `is' nothing pure, but of them defiled `are' even the mind and the conscience;

**[1:16]** God they profess to know, and in the works they deny `Him', being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work disapproved.

**[2:1]** And thou -- be speaking what doth become the sound teaching;

**[2:2]** aged men to be temperate, grave, sober, sound in the faith, in the love, in the endurance;

**[2:3]** aged women, in like manner, in deportment as doth become sacred persons, not false accusers, to much wine not enslaved, of good things teachers,

**[2:4]** that they may make the young women sober-minded, to be lovers of `their' husbands, lovers of `their' children,

**[2:5]** sober, pure, keepers of `their own' houses, good, subject to their own husbands, that the word of God may not be evil spoken of.

**[2:6]** The younger men, in like manner, be exhorting to be sober-minded;

**[2:7]** concerning all things thyself showing a pattern of good works; in the teaching uncorruptedness, gravity, incorruptibility,

**[2:8]** discourse sound, irreprehensible, that he who is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having nothing evil to say concerning you.

**[2:9]** Servants -- to their own masters `are' to be subject, in all things to be well-pleasing, not gainsaying,

**[2:10]** not purloining, but showing all good stedfastness, that the teaching of God our Saviour they may adorn in all things.

**[2:11]** For the saving grace of God was manifested to all men,

**[2:12]** teaching us, that denying the impiety and the worldly desires, soberly and righteously and piously we may live in the present age,

**[2:13]** waiting for the blessed hope and manifestation of the glory of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ,

**[2:14]** who did give himself for us, that he might ransom us from all lawlessness, and might purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works;

**[2:15]** these things be speaking, and exhorting, and convicting, with all charge; let no one despise thee!

**[3:1]** Remind them to be subject to principalities and authorities, to obey rule, unto every good work to be ready,

**[3:2]** of no one to speak evil, not to be quarrelsome -- gentle, showing all meekness to all men,

**[3:3]** for we were once -- also we -- thoughtless, disobedient, led astray, serving desires and pleasures manifold, in malice and envy living, odious -- hating one another;

**[3:4]** and when the kindness and the love to men of God our Saviour did appear

**[3:5]** (not by works that `are' in righteousness that we did but according to His kindness,) He did save us, through a bathing of regeneration, and a renewing of the Holy Spirit,

**[3:6]** which He poured upon us richly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour,

**[3:7]** that having been declared righteous by His grace, heirs we may become according to the hope of life age-during.

**[3:8]** Stedfast `is' the word; and concerning these things I counsel thee to affirm fully, that they may be thoughtful, to be leading in good works -- who have believed God; these are the good and profitable things to men,

**[3:9]** and foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about law, stand away from -- for they are unprofitable and vain.

**[3:10]** A sectarian man, after a first and second admonition be rejecting,

**[3:11]** having known that he hath been subverted who `is' such, and doth sin, being self-condemned.

**[3:12]** When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis, for there to winter I have determined.

**[3:13]** Zenas the lawyer and Apollos bring diligently on their way, that nothing to them may be lacking,

**[3:14]** and let them learn -- ours also -- to be leading in good works to the necessary uses, that they may not be unfruitful.

**[3:15]** Salute thee do all those with me; salute those loving us in faith; the grace `is' with you all!
