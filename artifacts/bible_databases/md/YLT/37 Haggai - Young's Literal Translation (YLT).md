# Haggai - Young's Literal Translation (YLT)

**[1:1]** In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month, hath a word of Jehovah been by the hand of Haggai the prophet, unto Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and unto Joshua son of Josedech, the high priest, saying:

**[1:2]** Thus spake Jehovah of Hosts, saying: This people! -- they have said, `The time hath not come, The time the house of Jehovah `is' to be built.'

**[1:3]** And there is a word of Jehovah by the hand of Haggai the prophet, saying:

**[1:4]** Is it time for you -- you! To dwell in your covered houses, And this house to lie waste?

**[1:5]** And now, thus said Jehovah of Hosts, Set your heart to your ways.

**[1:6]** Ye have sown much, and brought in little, To eat, and not to satiety, To drink, and not to drunkenness, To clothe, and none hath heat, And he who is hiring himself out, Is hiring himself for a bag pierced through.

**[1:7]** Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: Set your heart to your ways.

**[1:8]** Go up the mountain, and ye have brought in wood, And build the house, and I am pleased with it. And I am honoured, said Jehovah.

**[1:9]** Looking for much, and lo, little, And ye brought `it' home, and I blew on it, Wherefore? -- an affirmation of Jehovah of Hosts, Because of My house that is waste, And ye are running -- each to his house,

**[1:10]** Therefore, over you refrained have the heavens from dew, And the land hath refrained its increase.

**[1:11]** And I proclaim draught on the land, And on the mountains, and on the corn, And on the new wine, and on the oil, And on what the ground doth bring forth, And on man, and on beast, And on all labour of the hands.'

**[1:12]** And Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, and Joshua son of Josedech, the high priest, and all the remnant of the people, do hearken to the voice of Jehovah their God, and unto the words of Haggai the prophet, as Jehovah their God had sent him, and the people are afraid of the face of Jehovah.

**[1:13]** And Haggai, messenger of Jehovah, in messages of Jehovah, speaketh to the people, saying: `I `am' with you, an affirmation of Jehovah.'

**[1:14]** And Jehovah doth stir up the spirit of Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua son of Josedech, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people, and they come in, and do work in the house of Jehovah of Hosts their God,

**[1:15]** in the twenty and fourth day of the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king.

**[2:1]** In the seventh `month', in the twenty and first of the month, hath a word of Jehovah been by the hand of Haggai the prophet, saying:

**[2:2]** `Speak, I pray thee, unto Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and unto Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest, and unto the remnant of the people, saying:

**[2:3]** Who among you hath been left that saw this house in its former honour? And what are ye seeing it now? Is it not, compared with it, as nothing in your eyes?

**[2:4]** And now, be strong, O Zerubbabel, An affirmation of Jehovah, And be strong, O Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest, And be strong, all ye people of the land, An affirmation of Jehovah, And do ye -- (for I `am' with you, An affirmation of Jehovah of Hosts) --

**[2:5]** The thing that I covenanted with you, In your coming forth from Egypt, And My Spirit is remaining in your midst, fear not.

**[2:6]** For thus said Jehovah of Hosts: Yet once more -- it `is' a little, And I am shaking the heavens and the earth, And the sea, and the dry land,

**[2:7]** And I have shaken all the nations, And they have come `to' the desire of all the nations, And I have filled this house `with' honour, Said Jehovah of Hosts.

**[2:8]** Mine `is' the silver, and Mine the gold, An affirmation of Jehovah of Hosts.

**[2:9]** Greater is the honour of this latter house, Than of the former, said Jehovah of Hosts, And in this place do I give peace, An affirmation of Jehovah of Hosts.'

**[2:10]** On the twenty and fourth of the ninth `month', in the second year of Darius, hath a word of Jehovah been by the hand of Haggai the prophet, saying:

**[2:11]** Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: `Ask, I pray thee, the priests `of' the law, saying:

**[2:12]** Lo, one doth carry holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and he hath come with his skirt against the bread, or against the pottage, or against the wine, or against the oil, or against any food -- is it holy?' And the priests answer and say, `No.'

**[2:13]** And Haggai saith, `If the unclean of body doth come against any of these, is it unclean?' And the priests answer and say, `It is unclean.'

**[2:14]** And Haggai answereth and saith, `So `is' this people, and so `is' this nation before Me -- an affirmation of Jehovah -- and so `is' every work of their hands, and that which they bring near there -- it is unclean.

**[2:15]** And now, lay `it', I pray you, to your heart, From this day, and onwards, Before the laying of stone to stone in the temple of Jehovah.

**[2:16]** From that time `one' hath come to a heap of twenty, And it hath been ten, He hath come unto the wine-fat to draw out fifty purahs, And it hath been twenty.

**[2:17]** I have smitten you with blasting, And with mildew, and with hail -- All the work of your hands, And there is none of you with Me, An affirmation of Jehovah.

**[2:18]** Set `it', I pray you, to your heart, from this day and onwards, from the twenty and fourth day of the ninth `month', even from the day that the temple of Jehovah hath been founded, set `it' to your heart.

**[2:19]** Is the seed yet in the barn? And hitherto the vine and the fig, And the pomegranate, and the olive-tree, Have not borne -- from this day I bless.'

**[2:20]** And there is a word of Jehovah a second time unto Haggai, on the twenty and fourth of the month, saying:

**[2:21]** `Speak unto Zerubbabel governor of Judah, saying: I am shaking the heavens and the earth,

**[2:22]** And have overturned the throne of kingdoms, And I have destroyed the strength of kingdoms of the nations, And overturned chariot and its charioteers, And come down have horses and their riders, Each by the sword of his brother.

**[2:23]** In that day -- an affirmation of Jehovah of Hosts, I take thee, Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, My servant -- an affirmation of Jehovah, And have set thee as a signet, for on thee I have fixed, An affirmation of Jehovah of Hosts!
